7c7828a2-f40d-4fb3-8b6a-df406851ad73,"Hello. Hello Mr. McGill. Yes, I'm speaking. Good evening. This is Erin with Positgen. How you doing, uh, I tried to call you back. Sorry I missed your call. Yes sir. No problem. I was just giving you a call in regards to the case that was open on your account. Uh-huh. Yes sir, um, I want to let you know we're on a recorded line for quality assurance. Sure. Uh, what issues are you having experiencing today? Uh, what, what issue I'm experiencing that? Yes, sir, I, I kinda know what's going on, but I just wanted to, you know, maybe get you, give you the opportunity to see what issues you've had, you know, leading up to this point. Oh, so that's very easy. So basically, um, the, uh, solar panels that we have, right, that was installed, you know, we have so many different issues, um, in the last, you know, almost a year since installation, right? Um, so the, um, inverter is not working, uh, the panels are not connected. Uh, we're not producing electricity and, you know, so on and so on. So it's been, you know, dragging on for all these months and, you know, lately, we, you know, basically not producing anything. We're paying some like $*** every month. Uh, because we're not producing any electricity and now, uh, you know, we have to pay, uh, you guys $*** a month for nothing. So that's the freaking problem. So I have the, you know, piece of shit installed on my roof that I'm not doing anything whatsoever. Um, and instead of saving money, I'm paying Conson, and I'm paying you for nothing. So why, you know, why did they install it? I mean, what was the purpose? Just uh to give you money? Right, so that's, that's the. You know, for the, uh, the purpose is to actually, you know, promote green energy and also to save you money on your utility bill. Uh, there is an expectation in which we, you know, have for the system's production. We are in the, you know, cooler months and the the region that you're in, you're not gonna receive the sunlight. Mm. No, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. You're absolutely wrong. You're absolutely wrong. It's not about that. And I sent an email this morning even, right? So I'm not sure if you have seen it or not, but, uh, even, uh, last year during the summertime, we didn't produce anything. Uh, inventory is not working right now. The inventor giving me whole bunch of different error messages, right? So, and I was told that the original one was uh uh a used or refurbished one in quotes and I had to have the new one and then people came and fixed it, we changed it and then they said, oh, by the way. Your panels are not connected correctly, right, so you only have ** kind of working and, uh, uh, but you have **. * we're so sorry we're gonna connect another uh * or few units. It's like I mean seriously. And right now, the same thing. If you look at the bills, if you look at uh the production, nothing, nothing is happening. So it's not about colder, it's not about not being in the sun, no. Something terribly wrong with the system. OK, and before you guys came, you know, I was paying whatever $*** to call Edison. And I'm still paying the same to, and now I have to pay you $***. Why? For what? Yes sir, so, um. We actually, you know, before we actually install the system there is a feasibility analysis that we complete, uh, when we install the system our rates are based on the feasibility analysis. I know you've stated that you're, uh, that you are responsible for $*** monthly depositing, so those rates are based on the production that we guarantee to, uh, you know. Yeah, I know. Mhm. Mhm. The the the system is guaranteed to produce this amount. It's not we are going to live up to our savings guarantee and that is about **% of what um we expect the system to produce and from inception it does look like the system has produced within that, uh, ** percentile the system has produced **,***. Mhm. Mhm. Uh, kilowatts, that was the expectation in the system actually produced *,*** kilowatts just based on lifetime, uh, in the summer of, as you stated in the summer of ****. I'm gonna look at that one moment. I can I'll start from April. Listen, I know all the numbers, OK? I, I, I have it in front of me. I have all the bills and I send you guys all the bills, right, uh, from Con Edison, and I know exactly what was being produced. I have all the air locks, um, I have all the recordings, video recordings of people coming and changing the, uh, inverters and connecting the, uh, faulty, uh, panels on the roof, um, and you know, so I have all these records. So what I'm saying that right now, based on all the analysis that we have done so far, We're not even close to producing even **% of what we have to produce even during this, uh, you know, month of, uh, uh, as you call the, you know, winter and, you know, solstice and stuff like that. So, uh, there's fundamentally, uh, something wrong with the system. Uh, so are you stating that the system isn't large enough or are you stating that the current system that you have isn't producing what you, what is expected to produce for the winter months? I am stating that it's not producing. Anything that we're supposed to expect not during this particular month but overall. OK. And, and, and don't forget that in the summer time last year, we didn't produce anything whatsoever because the system was simply broken. Yeah And we even got the uh checks uh uh you know, from you guys. You refunded us because everything was not working at all. OK. So it's not about producing less or producing more. And the same thing is happening right now. The inventor gives us error messages left and right. It's so simple just to go in and look at the error messages on the freaking thing. I'm not sure why people are not monitoring that. If I can see it, you can see it, right? Yes sir, so there, there aren't any error messages on our end actually from November of **** to March *rd as of today, the expectation for your system has been **** kilowatts. That's the expectation, but the system actually produced *,*** kilowatts so. Hold on a second. So, so, hold on a second. So, you're telling me that right now. You're not seeing the uh uh the error on the inverter. That's what they're telling me. Uh Uh no, sir, I don't work in, uh, that would be another department. I, I don't have a viewpoint on the system. Well, exactly, exactly. That's what I'm saying, OK, that's what I'm saying. You don't see other people don't want to see, right? So, uh, the, the first error that I see, uh, it was reported on February **, ****, *:** p.m. and ** seconds error **** watchdog reset. Correct, but I That the thing comes on and off. That means that the inverter is not communicating with the panels and it's not, it's trying to shut it down itself and restart itself all the time. There's something wrong with the freaking box. So how can we actually talk about anything if you don't see the same messages and no one is looking into the issue? Well, because those error message may be null and void, we, I would typically go from what the system is production is. So what I, what I can see is the system. I listen, I don't know. I don't listen. I don't know where you're coming from and what you're doing. I'm just telling you that this system is not working, not producing, uh, what we're supposed to, OK? And I'm not, I, I don't have to pay coor Ason, you know, almost $*** every month and pay you $*** for nothing. So if if there's. Constantly. So we for us to be able to resolve issues we do have to trust the figures. Uh, I'm not asking you to trust me as an agent, but the figures that I am reading to you on the screen, I can send them to you. Uh, there's no way for me to make these figures up, nor would I ever make these figures up in the last * days, the system has produced what we expected it to produce, um. Mhm. Uh, yesterday, um, the first, the system was expected to produce ** kilowatts to produce ** kilowatts, uh, that was on the first, on the second, which was yesterday. The system was expected to. Mhm, mhm. And who told you, and who told you was supposed to produce ** kg? Well, How do you calculate this? Based on our feasibility analysis, when you, when you sign on to have your solar system we come by we complete a feasibility analysis that way we determine what the system is gonna produce all the way to a from a monthly to an annual to a monthly to a daily uh. Mhm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. So, so we have ** pounds, right? Each panel produces *** watts of electricity, right? Each hour with the best conditions, we're supposed to produce almost ** kilowatts, right? Multiplied by whatever, * hours, right? * hours. OK, it gives you a number. It's much more than **, **, as you're saying. So there is something wrong. And besides, people that live next to me in the same house, the same side, the same roof, OK? And they have other uh panels and so they have producing more than I am. Correct. It's, it's March. It's it is in the March, uh, so. I know, I know, right now, I, you're not listening to what I'm saying. You're not listening to what I'm saying. You know, we're comparing apples to apples, not apples to oranges. So the guy is right here next to me, you know, he's producing **. And I'm **. he may have a larger system than you, he may have a larger. So, it's what? Because what? No, no, absolutely not. No, absolutely not. We can't, we can't, we can't talk over each other. We can't scream at each other. So, if you want, we, we, we, we have to calm down. So if we want resolve, you're gonna ask me a question. I'm going to answer it and when I answer the question, because I'm reading figures, you have no choice but to accept. Well, exactly, exactly. I, it, it, yeah, so. I am not, I'm not asking the questions. I'm not asking you the questions. I'm just saying it's not working. It's not working, we're not producing. What we, OK, but, but this is how, but this is how we're gonna move forward with what it resolved, sir. Yes, I understand what you're saying, and my job is to resolve it and either if it's not working to provide the appropriate resolve and if it is to explain to you. So Listen, listen, I, uh, this is the end of the conversation, doesn't understand anything, OK? The inverter right now gives error messages. It does not work. You stated that this is the end of the conversation, sir, so how could I help you? I, I want to help you. I don't want, I don't. So, You're not helping me. You're not helping. I, I'm telling you, I'm not paying you guys. I'm not. Well, in what way would you like, in what way would you like any assistance, sir? Yeah, uh Assistance, you have to refund the money that I'm paying to Con Edison. What Correct, so, so that we would have to indeed verify that the system is not working correct? If you're stating that the system isn't working, then we would have to verify that this because if that were the case I could, I could, I could call my utility company and state that my utilities aren't working but they would first verify whether or not they're working. That's all. OK, go, go and verify. And then we would move forward with a refund. So now I am attempting to verify it to you. There is no other follow up necessarily needed. We are completing a savings analysis to ensure that you are saving money, uh, so that is a separate, uh, entity that's a separate issue, but to actually verify if the system is working, uh, we are doing that now, so you did state that you're. Mm. OK. Labor produces about ** kilowatts during the daytime. Your system does indeed produce that, but that is during the the summertime. So June **th, ****, I mean sorry, July *st, ****, your system actually produced **.* kilowatts. It may have rained on the **th. It produced ** kilowatts on the **th. It produced. Mm. Uh, ** on the **th it produced ** kilowatts so the system has been generating, producing, and reporting this entire time. If there is an issue, uh, our savings analysis will indeed, uh, verify whether or not there is an issue with the system's production, um, and maybe we not. Mhm. Production but maybe the usage of the system or if there isn't any issues but we'll verify that with the savings analysis now for attempting to verify if the system is indeed working that we we can do that we are doing now and yes I'm verifying even up until yesterday the system overproduced what we expected. No. Yeah, yeah, over we overproduced, OK, I got it. So, uh, uh, for what you just, uh, told me, yeah, probably we did some production last year because the inverter was put, uh, uh, you know, a brand new unit, right? We got the brand new unit to start working. And people who came and connected, uh, not working, uh, uh, full panels that we have on the roof, right. So, and they start producing something maybe right now the same issue is happening, right? Not all of the panels are producing because they lost connection on them. They're not, you know, connected at all again. I don't know. So that's the thing. You cannot resolve this over the phone. You have to send guys, you know, they have to take a look at the roof. They have to go up there and get their hardware connected to the inverter and stuff like that and identify issue. This is what they have done, uh, you know, last time they came and they said, oh my God, yeah, your * panels were never connected actually. So, uh, in regards to those three panels not being connected, uh, it wouldn't completely cause the system not to not work. It would cause maybe lower production, so I do see the production, uh, maybe take a dip in, uh, April, maybe toward the end of April, so the system was expected to produce *,*** kilowatts in April. It produced ***. Right. Yeah. And it seems as though a repair was was made in June because as of July the system was expected to produce *,*** but it produced *,*** kilowatts. So there, uh, there seems to be a dippage in production for those three months. Uh, we could credit the account for * months moving forward. Mhm. Mm. Um, because there was a dig in production, but the system did indeed produce during that period. So May, uh, again, I'll say April, April, the expectation was *,***. You produced ***. May the expectation was *,***. You produced ***, and again the repair was made in June. The expectation was *,*** and the system produced *,***. Uh, so again I would acknowledge these * months as being a digent production, um. But moving forward, the system has produced more than the expectation monthly, uh, July, uh, again it was the expectation was *,***. The system produced *,*** August. The expectation was *,***. It produced *,***, so it did, uh, but was. Uh, ** kilowatts, uh, September, the expectation was *** to produced *** again * kilowatts. October, the expectation was ****. It produced ***. uh, November the expectation was *:**. It produced ***. December, the expectation was ***. It produced ***. January, the expectation was ***. It produced ***. February, the expectation was ***. It produced ***, and so far this month, the expectation has been ** kilowatts and it's produced ***. It hasn't completed the, uh, actual production for today, so tomorrow we will get the full production from today. Mm, so, so why, uh, why then the, uh, cumulative, uh, the meter energy credits that, uh, Cornes and calculating, uh, were, uh, completely zero, from November **th to, uh, February **th. Uh, possibly because the system isn't producing as much as it typically would produce and all of the kilowatts that the system actually produced you used, um. If you use all of the kilowatts, you won't sell anything back so the figure that you see on your utility bill is your sell back that isn't what the system produces that is what. Uh, I, I, I understand, I understand that, but, uh, but again, you know, if you look at November, right, uh, we use only ***. OK. Mhm. Right. Uh, and then the, the crate was *. And uh we were built and then it was *** and * and *** and * so. That that really tells us that whatever for the next, uh, I mean for the last like * months, whatever, since October actually I'm looking at that, uh, you know, we're doing shit like nothing. Let's see if you had any. Uh, it cannot be *. You cannot be zero. You cannot be zero, right? You cannot. Uh, let's Yes sir I'm looking over your accounts because there was uh there was a case or two open no alerts or errors showing in the portal. Oh Oh listen, I, I, I'm next to the, uh, uh, the inventor right now, right? I see all the error messages and, um, so, um, my suggestion is to send the crew. Uh, take a look at the hardware again, um, get on the roof, um, get to the, uh, computer systems, make sure that it's all, uh, properly connected, um, no error messages whatsoever, uh, because, you know, it, it's really getting out of hand and, and, and, and, you know, understand me, I mean, I'm an IT guy, OK. I can go in and I can understand all those errors, you know, on the fly. Right, if I can do it. Um, any of your, uh, contractors can do the same. And this is what happened last time, right? I was told everything's fine, everything's hunky dory, blah, blah, blah, but oops, no. Oh, nothing works. Yeah. We got to change this. We gotta do that. We got, OK, so go. Send the guys in. Let them check it. And besides, Um, I'm still, you know, uh, getting some degrees. Um, falling from my roof, right? So when we stole the shit, it's still falling. Right? So, um, But it's a problem. God forbid is gonna, you know, someone, my kids, myself, where, you know, my dog's gonna hit with this debris, like metal parts, bolts and stuff like that. Oh gosh, you. You're gonna have a problem. Correct. Um, yes, sir, I know that you are indeed a channel, uh, with one of our channel teams. I'm gonna request if we actually send text out to channel teams. Um, I know from our viewpoint that regards to confirm if the system is producing and again a saving. Analysis is being complete. Once I get that information, I can give you a call back if we are indeed um gonna dispatch a tech out they'll follow up with you uh but if not then you know we may have to respond accordingly. So just give me an opportunity to get that information from you for you. I'm sorry, and then I can give you a call back. That's fine. OK, thank you sir you enjoy your day. You too bye.

1c1d2943-994e-4425-8c49-256b2bdf9a34,"Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Positgen. This is Brittany on a recorded line. How may I assist you? Britney, I need to speak to, I think her name is, it starts with a D. She's in charge of my area like um I had problems with my, with my service, so they were supposed to be giving me some money off my account. Well, they charged me. Denise OK, let me take a look. What's your service address, ma'am? It's [REDACTED]. OK, Miss Daphne? you were speaking to? OK. Daphne, is she in? cause I, yeah, cause they charged me way more than what my bill normally is. Alright, give me one second and let me see if she's available. OK, hold on. No hang up, Ms. uh Wilson. And I'm not. You are on hold. All right. now. Thank you for calling. Your call is very important to us and will be answered in the order it was received. Oh. All right, Ms. Wilson, it looks like Daphne is assisting another customer. Um, I can see if I can try to help, but if you already, you know, um, spoke with Daphne, you want me to just have her give you a call back when she gets off the other line, I can do that as well. Yeah, let me see if you can figure it out. Let me see if you can figure it out. So why did they charge me $** for this month? So she already knows, yeah. Mhm, mhm. OK, so. My bill is normally $**. All right, Lily. So I had a late fee because, let me see. So I paid $** but that fee was late because I forgot the card was canceled. Mhm. So y'all got that fee late. So that could be that that looks like where the uh late charge was coming because you are correct that one was processed on the **th that's outside of the grace period. So um that looks like the reason why it was charged your account was charged $**. Well But they, they weren't supposed to even charge me because y'all owed me money back. OK. Because my, my bill, my, my bill for like * months, for like * months, it was low, low, low, low, low, and then all of a sudden it just jumped way up. OK, so did they give you? So I sent her. They never called me to tell me what happened with that. OK. Um, But she said they weren't gonna charge me, but they did. Yeah, I saw you sent the bills and she opened that case and someone's supposed to be actually doing the savings analysis on the account. Let's see. And normally while they're doing it, they won't charge you, but they, they charging me. Well, I don't know about not charging during the savings analysis because I know that that that's something that is just an analysis of the account that doesn't stop payment, but. They never, they, they never, they never charged me, they never charged me before. They would just pull the card and then they just waited. When, wait, you mean, you say they'll score the card? No, they pulled my card while, you know, without not charging me until it was time to charge me again like they would give me so many months for free, so they will pull my card. So I'm thinking she said go ahead and pay like the $** I just paid. She said go ahead and pay for this month, and she said by then they should have it figured out what, what, how much they're gonna give you off your bill, but they charged. OK. OK, right, so, so she said to pay this month, which is March, and then they'll figure out? She told me to pay, no, they, she told me to pay for February. And when I paid that $** she told me to pay again and she by then by the next billing period, they should have it all figured out how much they're gonna give you back towards your bill. All right, let me Mhm. OK, let me, let me see, let me try Daphne one more time because I don't quite see um. I see notes, but I, I wanna make sure that um. I need to work on Because I don't wanna change anything on the account if she's already working on something, so give me one second, I'm gonna try one more time, OK? Hold on * *nd. You are on hold. Daphne. You are on hold. You are on hold. Now thank you for calling. Your call is very important to us and will be answered in the order it was received. OK, Ms. Wilson, she's still not available. Um, I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm gonna have to look into this cause I, I don't know what's going on with this account and so I you know I do wanna help, but I wanna make sure that I'm not doing something if Daphne has already started working on the account. It, and it's just that we haven't. I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just call, I'm gonna just call, I'm gonna just call Daphne back in a few minutes cause I got some other stuff I gotta take care of. All right, bye. OK. Yes, ma'am. All right, thank you.","Customer called regarding unexpectedly high bill.  A savings analysis was supposedly in progress, but the customer was still charged.

Um, if you guys would be able to help me with that? Sure thing. Um, may I have your address including phone number for security purposes? Yeah, uh, address is **-**. ***nd Street, Belrose, New York. ***** Thank you and your And the phone number is ***. Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. No, sorry, I was going to ask for your phone number, yes ma'am. Uh, yeah, ***-***-****. Thank you, and bear with me one moment. May I ask what form is it that you have received? It was the IT ***. I had actually called um last Fri this Friday that just passed, and I did speak to someone who was able to give me some information. Um, and they did tell me that I would probably receive a call back maybe from the tax department, um. She was like, usually they don't mail out the forms completely empty. There's like some stuff filled in. So was it, uh, I haven't gotten a call back so. One moment. Sure thing.

You are on hold. Thank you so much for your patience. I do apologize for the long hold. Uh, no problem. Yes, Ms. Roch, I, I was trying to get more confirmation as I was reading um the notations. I believe you and I spoke on Friday and I have sent over the communications to our um tax department to get more clarity on how these forms are being sent and if they're being sent clear sometimes what the explanation I may give you. Hello? All these I do apologize, they don't take any inbound calls and they definitely don't really call. I do believe when I spoke with you I was going to see if I can get more clarity or if they do want to contact you, they can, but as of right now, I do apologize that I did try to get more information for you, but it doesn't look like um they have responded to me, so I do apologize for having you hold. And I also did reach out to my team leads to try and get more information for this IT *** form to see if we can help you with giving you more information than what I have given you regarding like the the amount that you paid and the date that it was um installed so I do apologize as of right now uh we're still working on trying to get you that information. Mhm. Yeah. But um if there is any information that I can give you, rest assured that as soon as I get any information from either my team leads or the customer um tax department, we would definitely or I will definitely reach back to you myself so that way at least you can have more peace of mind of what the IT *** form and how it's usually being sent and if there's any information that I can provide you furthermore that and where I can find it and I with transparency, do apologize that. Um, I do also recommend to contact your tax preparer and seeing if maybe. How they are more knowledgeable and how these forms should be coming can definitely be of more assistance or faster assistance if needed. Yeah. OK, yeah, uh, I'll do that then. Um, and I guess I'll wait to hear back as well. If that's possible. Absolutely. As soon as I get more information, I would definitely uh follow back up with you. Is the best number that I can reach you at ending in ****? Yeah, that's the best number. I'm going to set a task for myself to reach back to you within the next ** hours to at least get an actual update for you if anything and if I don't, I do apologize that I don't have an update, but I will still communicate with you of what I have found out if anything. I'm Yeah, that would, that would be great. Thank you. Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you so much for your patience, Mrs. Roge. Is there anything else that I can help you with at the moment? I No, that was, that was actually, um, I did receive a voicemail uh from you guys about, uh, let me see when I got that, um. I believe it was around the **th. Um, they were saying that there was supposed to be some material that was delivered to us and it needed to be installed. Uh, I'm not really sure what that call was about. Oh yes, so it does look like there is some uh products that. Um, Bear with me one moment. Have you received any um package from the Solar company or from us? No, I haven't, which is why I wasn't sure like exactly who was calling, like if that was like a trusted caller. Understood. I'm going to go ahead and update that case as well. It does look like I need to let um the department our warehouse department has contacted you because yes, it is a legitimate call. There is some products that need to be switched out on your solar system and. Um, so I didn't get any packages. OK. Those products do need to um come to your home because the the manufacturer sends them directly to you. But I do believe whenever uh customers unfortunately are not reachable, like in your case, they end up canceling that shipping and they send it over to our warehouse. So I am going to let them know that you still have not received the package. Um, it does look like it's been over ** weeks since they contacted you. So I do believe that it is going to end up having to be scheduled through them. OK. So what's going to happen is that I'm also gonna follow up with you within the next * days with that same thing of letting you know when a technician will be scheduled to come out. But first we need to confirm if the package has made it to either the warehouse or what the status is on that. I do apologize for that, but I am definitely going to, and that's kind of what happens is that. Mhm. OK, yeah, I, I apologize for not freaking out too. Yes ma'am, one moment, I'm almost done. Sorry, I'm sorry for my silence. I was just typing all of this so I didn't forget it. One moment. Hello? Good. Oh no, that's OK. Yeah, I, I had meant to reach out about that call, but I just got too busy as well, so I, I like forgot. Yes ma'am. It was a voicemail that was left to you that day, right? Yeah, it was a voicemail. Alrighty so I just went ahead also contacted the warehouse manager to get more information of where that part is and if it is in our warehouse that you have already contacted us and letting us know that we. have not sent you that package, but like I mentioned, more than likely it's in our warehouse because when customers are are unresponsive or you know because we haven't got any information from you, we wanted to make sure that the part doesn't get lost so that's what's going to happen and just in the next * days, um, as soon as I contacted you about the IT *** for if I have any update. Mhm. I will also update with you with the date of uh scheduling. I don't have control of the scheduling only the warehouse management does, but as soon as I get more information, um, I will definitely relate to you when we can uh get that part installed for you, OK? And it's called an inverter. Yeah. Yeah, that, that'd be great. Skin burger. OK. Yeah. All righty. Thank you so much for telling me about that cause I, I was looking at your cases, but this one was um looking like it's new. So given that it was there, I do believe that the scheduler does need to get contact ASAP to get this resolved for you, OK? So, please bear with us and I will talk to you very soon, OK? OK. All right, thank you. Is there anything else that I can help you with today? No, that was all. Thank you so much. And I know that we confirmed email last time that we spoke, but when you just verify it one more time so make making sure that the scheduling department does also have the right communications methods with you? Uh yeah, R D I V Y A. **** at gmail.com. Perfect, thank you so much for your patience and we'll be talking soon, Ms. Roch. Thank you have a good one.

Can I verify your service address? [REDACTED]. Yes, sir. And how may I help you today? OK, I'm calling because my, I know I've been missing some payments, but I'm trying to see why my payments are going up so much. I mean my my remaining balance maybe a couple of months ago was *** and something, now I got my remaining balance up to uh *** and something. And why does it go up? I'm almost close to paying it out. And I didn't come from $**,*** from the beginning. Right. Yes, sir. Mm To almost the end, I got in bad shape where I couldn't do and I made plans, but I can't see why it's going up now. So, the remaining contract balance on the invoices are referring to what that balance will be once that invoice is paid. Does that make sense? So let's say in January, it said $*** and then you made a payment of $** right? If that balance next month would be lower than the ***. Does that make sense? Because it's referring to after you pay that invoice that it's printed on. Now, if you got behind on some payments, then yeah, it wouldn't change because the invoice wasn't paid, so now it's just stacking. Um, I'm taking a look at your, well, I'd like to take a look at a further look into your account. I need your service address, Mr. Johnny. Mhm. **** Eagle. OK. Um, yes, sir. So I, I see some bills here. I see your amount for this month is about $** and that's due to a late fee. But OK. Let's take a look. I wanna look at a couple of your invoices to look at the contract balance to see what you were talking about. So for February's bill, it was **,***. Go here. This one is from December. So yes, sir, it's going down. The remaining contract balance is going down as you pay it, it goes down, which I'll tell you right now how many payments you have left. You only have * payments remaining. On the contract But what I'm saying, my, my, my. And Remaining balance was a whole lot lower. It was half this and it I mean, it raised up. I know I was late, but it, it said it raised up. I could understand late fees, but it looked like fees are being You know, it's, it's the whole fee is being added to the contract. So which bill did it start going up because I'm looking at the last * months and the the amount is still increasing. So like for example. OK, I got, OK, I got what is my bill because I'm looking at an old bill and it's **, so what is my balance now? Let's see, let's go to Marches. Um, ***. ** is what's listed here. So after you pay this invoice, then it'll be that. But like I said before, you have * payments remaining, you only pay $** a month, so that's about $*** including taxes left. That's all that's left on this account. OK, so. What What would be the remaining balance? That's what I'm telling you right now, Mr. Johnny, $*** is what you have left, and that's including taxes. You pay $** a month and I'm looking at the payment schedule, you have * payments remaining. OK. OK. Well, I'm looking at $*** to pay the whole thing off. Yes. OK, that's what I wanna do. And like I said, that is including taxes. That's, I mean, What is my, I mean, what is my? Because the remaining contract balance on the bill right next to it in that in the small letters it says balance does not reflect taxes. So on this bill I'm looking at right here for that's due March *th, it's not, it's not including it if that makes sense. OK. No, um. I just wanna get a total amount and see if I could pay this out *. $*** Mr. Johnny, that's what's remaining on the contract. That's it. That's how you pay out this lease. It's just $***. OK, and, and once I pay that I'm just down to the service charge? Mm. Say again for me? Once I pay that remaining balance off I'm down to just the service charge per month. No, sir. At that point, you have a few options. You can choose to keep the system and renew, and at that point, if you renew, whether you do * years or ** years, you will pay $** a month. You can choose to have them upgraded where we take down the system you have right now. Put up a brand new system, the latest and greatest technology we have, and then you start over another **** year lease agreement, or you can choose to have them removed. And if you choose to have them removed, we come out, we take them down with no cost to you. We weatherize the roof so that there are no holes left, um, and then, you know, we go our separate ways. When you get a little closer to that last payment, we'll go ahead and send out a document with the options listed out that way, you know, you have some time to So Kind of think about it and decide how you want to move forward. OK. Well, what I'll do today I'm gonna put *** down if that's I could do it like that. OK, that's fine. And and I'll try next month to try to. Finished, well, I know I still have some they finish it out. Yes, sir. Now, I do have you, um, I have a card on file ending in ****. Is that the card you'd like to use as the funding source today? The same one you use all the time, uh-huh. All right. I'm gonna go ahead and submit this for processing. Let me know when you're ready for that confirmation number. OK. Excuse me. Give me a few minutes. No, you're fine. Take your time. No, I'll talk to someone else that was there to do. OK. That Joe, I just do. I'm going back out there. Are you ready for that confirmation, Mr. Johnny? Yeah, you could just, yeah, you can give it to me. OK. I Number one Wait a minute, I, I don't have a pen. I usually just let them rust it. Oh. Just put it down, OK. OK. All right, I'll update the notes here on the account so that your account manager knows that you went ahead and made that payment for the ***, and then next month, you know, you'll take your, take those plans next steps to go ahead um and figure out how you want to do the rest of the balance.

Hi there, um, I've had panels installed in my house now for probably, I don't know, * or * years I guess, and I'm just, I'm just not satisfied with the amount of power I'm producing because I, I keep getting these electric bills like the last * months have been almost $*** each and I, I just don't know if I'm getting any, any use out of my panels. I, my And I know it's been cold and there's, you know, it's been cold the last two months here in Louisiana, but there's nobody home during the day. It's, we're only using, you know, from, from * o'clock in the morning till * o'clock at night, there's nobody home. I mean, I, I don't know if I'm selling I should be selling back to the grid because I don't think I'm should be using that much power. Kind of Yes sir, Monty, uh, let me go ahead and pull up your account here to give you the support. Can you please provide me your address? [REDACTED]. Thank you so much. Give me one moment. I will thank you. Perfect, and this is under Mr. Richard uh. Simon Simon, my apologies. Diane. Simona. Hi, Mr. uh Simon, I, I have your account here. Let me go ahead and pull up your solar protection just just to see if your solar panels are producing as as expected within your uh house right now. OK. OK, Ms. Richard, so I'm checking here within the production of your, within the production of your solar panels, but it's not giving me any reading within our monitoring, uh, system. I'm trying to pull up your information to see if they can give me a database, but it seems like there might be an error going on within our monitoring side. Let me go ahead and send a report here to IAT to see if we can get someone from field service to double check just to make sure your system. is producing along with making sure uh your solar panels are in production as well. Uh, most likely what was gonna happen is I will go ahead and create a case here regarding to give us a report on your solar panel's production so that way we can see if your solar panels are producing. If in the case that your solar panels are underperforming, we will go ahead and notify you and along with uh scheduling a technician to be sent out to your location regarding any uh site inspection and maintenance with your solar panels. OK. OK. Yes, sir. Yeah, it just, it just doesn't like I'm, I'm getting, I'm getting my bank for my buck. You know, My deepest, yes, and my deepest apologies regarding that as well. Uh, rest assured, once we resolve this, uh, once we get this, uh, situated and once if it shows, uh, that once we receive the report showing that if it's under production and if we're at fault, we will most likely give you a credit within your account, uh, on the month that you have been underperforming. OK. Um, and I, I mean, I think I've been under for since I've gotten them, but that's, that's another, that's another story. Because I, when I, when I had these installed, I had these installed, I thought, you know, I, I would be having, you know, almost ** payments for electric company. I had to pay every month. I pay every month electric still. OK. Got it, freezer, yes. So typically, uh, when it comes to like the overall savings, uh, within your solar panels, I know for a fact, let me see. Mhm. And like here, like, where is that information at? OK, here it is. I know for a fact, typically, uh, solar, the solar system generates energy based on the sunlight, uh, which naturally fluctuate throughout the year, uh, during the summer, during the sunnier months, uh, your system will generate more energy which kind of offsets, uh, more of your electricity costs. Of course. Uh, in the month, uh, with there's less sunlight, you might see a smaller savings because it reduced production. But over the, over the full year, this will typically balance out to deliver the savings you expected when you got the lease agreements with the solar panels. Uh, another, another factor that could overall be your overall energy usage is if your energy consumption has increased since installing the solar. Right. Mhm. That might affect the savings you see on your bill. Oh Mm No, it really has and it stayed the same and like I said, we're not even home half the day. You know, so I just, I just it seems like, you know, I should be, I should be banking energy during the day while we're not even here and selling it back to the, to the, to the grid or because what I, what I wanted to do, I wanted to install a solar panel, but if I'm not producing any any enough um solar uh production, uh there's no sense of getting a solar pan a solar battery. Got it for you, sir. And then that's very understand as well. So let me go ahead and see if I can get this report uh from field service so that way we can have the monetary system, uh, within your solar panels open uh report here within the system so that way we can go ahead and check to see if you're, uh, performing or underperforming and if it shows that you're underperforming, we will most likely give you a follow up regarding a technician to be sent over to your location. OK. OK, yeah, and I even had * extra panels put on last year and it doesn't seem like it's helped at all. Got it for you, sir, and my deepest apologies over this. Let me go ahead and create this case so that way I can go ahead and uh give you the case number. OK, are you local? Are you in Louisiana or are you out of out of state? Actually, uh, for uh, well, not unfortunately. I'm actually here, uh, remotely from Texas. Oh, OK, OK, alright, OK, because I didn't know if I had if I, if I needed to stop in at the posit in office here or something I would do that too, but. OK, alright, well just yeah just keep me, um, will I just get an email or something like you say or a phone call? Yes. Uh, we will go ahead and give you a follow-up callback. And just to confirm, we do have a good callback number. It's here listed as ***-***-****. That's correct. Got it. I will go ahead and uh leave here so that way we can go ahead and give you a follow-up call regarding the update on your case. OK alright thank you so much I appreciate it. You're very welcome, Mr. Richard. Besides from this, is there anything else I can also be in service? Um, not at this point, uh, thank you. Not a problem, sir. Thank you for calling Poso and Solar. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you so much. Patty Mardi Gras. Uh, oh, hey, happy morning go to you too. Tomorrow, but yeah, all right, thank you. You're welcome.

Yeah Yes, sir. Yes, I see that. Yes, sir. Yes. Yeah, that's your utility company. And uh I'm getting uh dunning notices here with a termination notice for the * of $***. OK, that's, that's the utility. I don't know what this. That's your National, National Grid is a utility company. Huh. That's right, and you guys were dealing with them during the uh. Yes. Yeah, one way we're in now. During the period you're going to put the solar panels on. Yeah, and then at the after we after we activate the solar panels, uh our, our dealings with them would be done. You know, aside from, you know. I kind of figured that, but I've been talking to a woman by the name of Daphne. Yeah. Yes, she's a she. Is she in your office? Well, she, she is uh she is uh actually, uh, she's an account manager. And I've been sending her a lot of material and asking her for help. Uh-huh. OK, well. I don't understand what National Grid's position is here, but you know, I live alone. I'm ** years old and I have to face this now, a termination notice. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, well, National Grid is, is, is your utility provider. Uh there, there, that's the electric company basically. That That's that's there, uh. That's right, but now they're looking for money. Yes, sir. They're looking for money. I don't understand how don't they get paid from, from somebody else like the government? Mhm. No. No, they have, they, they, they would send you a bill for anything above what the solar produces for your electric electrical uses. Well, how do I know? I, I have nothing here. I don't know what, what's going on with between National Grid and here. It, I don't know if they're who's liable for payment, no. Um Well, the national, national grid, that would be, that would be, uh, you would be liable for paying that. That's your, that's your utility bill, um, you know, that's, that's, that's your utility bill. I don't know how to explain that one, so. I have no clue. But am I going to be liable for for this money? Uh. Yes, sir. I, I, I. I thought the I thought. Well, National Grid is your utility National Grid is your utility provider, and yes, that, that would be, I mean, if, if they're saying that you have a bill with them, then, uh, I mean that would be between you and and National Grid, we don't, we wouldn't have anything to do with that. I don't know, I'm just so. I kind of figured that but I need help. I need, I can't even call them. They, they don't answer the phone. They, they, it's uh. Uh, Mhm. I can't get anything out of them as to why I'm, why did I buy the solar solar panels if it's not reducing my my bill. Well, I don't know that it isn't reproducing your bill. I mean, it's, it, you know, I can't say that it's not reducing your bill. It's producing, the system is, is, is functioning and producing electricity, but, you know, anything that you use in excess of what the uh system produces, the utility company is gonna send you a bill for, um, and you know, you know, that's Hm But I was paying this before the solar panels went in. Yeah, I, I, I don't know. My bills used to run around $***. Yes sir, um, I don't know what the, I don't know what the bill uh entails, so I couldn't, I, I, I, I, I couldn't really tell. Well, they have it and you're off I sent Daphne, uh, they sent me bulk, they sent me bulk bills. Uh, Mhm. And she's got them, but she hasn't returned them yet, and I, I've been asking her for her. I, I need something to explain to me. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, mhm. And uh they, uh, all they said was somebody over there looked at it. Look at the, they said something about I was, I don't even, I can't even understand what they were saying. Uh-huh. They, uh, but they, they have all my bills. If somebody could look at them and help me out. Mhm. Mhm. Well, let me, uh, let me. It seems like everybody's washing their hands and running in different directions. Now let me take, let me take a look at the cases for it and see what we got here. So Uh, Ok, so. OK, yeah. I do see that, uh, you know, Daphne had the Oh Definite has a bill, yeah, yeah, and then, uh, I'm looking at the case that they had opened for it, um, and that was in January. I sent him a lot of material. Um, yeah. I sent several packages to a Mhm. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I see that. And she hasn't returned my call, and the least she can do is call me. Yeah. But somebody must know what's going on down there. Well, I, I mean, our, our, our, our, our, our team reviewed them and I don't, I don't have a finding for them as to what they, what they found out. So, um. You know, I, I'm not really sure, so he. And now they're going to, they're going to terminate my. Yeah. You must have, you must have other customers in Massachusetts. What, what's happening to them? Yes, we have. Uh, nothing. I don't have any of them, but I mean I have, we have probably hundreds of hundreds maybe thousands of customers in Massachusetts, uh, but, uh, I don't have, I, I, I don't have any of them that are, you know, that I know of that that are going through this, the same issue. And they're all over New England National Grid. Yeah, yes sir, yes sir. Among others, I mean there's several others besides National Grid, but I don't see, you know, what's the, why did I buy the solar panels if I'm not going to get my bill reduced and I just don't understand it. Yes, sir. Mhm. Well, I, uh, uh, you know. That's what I'm trying to find out because there's a person that analyzed the bills, you know. Um, you know, and I'm just trying to find out what they are. They get the bills down there. Somebody in that works for Daphne has the original bills. I sent them all down there thinking I could get help from you guys. Yes. Yes. Yes sir, yes sir, and that's what I'm I'm, I'm, I'm requesting, uh, I'm sending a message to somebody right now. Uh, to find out. And what's your name? Hello. My name is Mark. Mark Yes. Last name?

Yes, sir. Yes, sir. All right. Why don't we, uh, why it's hard for you to understand what I'm going through and it's hard for me to explain it, so why don't we take some time, take a look at it. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Um All right, I, I, I should. Would you be willing to do that? Yes, Mr. Jordan, certainly, certainly. I just want to know what, what, what, what do I do with this termination bill? I, I, I would, I would say that that if their utility companies is talking about terminating your, your, your, your thing, I, I, I, I would think that uh. We'd want to get it paid. I will pay it. I don't, but the thing is, what do I do with the, uh, it's gonna start coming in every month again and I'm already paying you guys. So. Yes, Well, yeah, you're always gonna have the, the, the solar doesn't replace your utility bill. Uh, you know, the solar can help offset the utility, but it doesn't go away completely, um, you know. Well, I don't even know what the the they they sent me some bills. Mhm. They don't, it's somebody from your company was that works with uh Daphne said something about the double double payment or something or. Mhm. I don't know. Uh I don't know. That's why I'm, I'm. And if you look at those bills. Yeah, that's why I'm I'm reaching out to the person that did it. And they get, I asked them to. Mhm. Huh? I've reached out to the person that's actually uh doing that, sorry. So, yeah. You know, it's funny, I can't even call him on the phone. Call her They have recorders. They won't answer the phone. They won't answer the phone either. Oh, the National Grid. Yeah, National Grid, yeah, um, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of large corporations, uh, get to the point where they don't seem to want to talk to their customers. I don't understand it, to be honest with you, it doesn't make sense to me. Um, so, but, uh, so yeah, let me, uh. Yeah. Let me see if I can uh get it. Well, why don't you take a look at it? Take a look at those bills that I sent out to Daphne. She's got the originals and she's, she gave it to somebody she works with and he's, he's the one that made a comment about um they're double billing you or something, and but it ended there and I sent him a lot of material. Sure. Uh-huh. Yes. Mhm. Mhm. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand. So maybe you can take a look at it. Maybe we can come out to to something. I don't understand it at all. Mhm. Yes, sir. I, I'll I'll, I'll reach out to. I just thought it was good. Yeah, I'll reach out to them and find out uh and then we'll get back in touch with you and figure out what's what's going on, OK?
