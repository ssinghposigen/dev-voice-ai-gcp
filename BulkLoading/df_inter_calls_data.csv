Um, no, yes, it's in regards to an inquiry you, you submitted with us with, with the company that you have panels with. We're Positgen Solar. Oh wait a minute, oh, OK. So what if, oh yeah, right. OK. Yeah So it's so just to, just to let you know that the call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes and just to move forward uh to be able to help you out um I did just need to verify just three things and can you verify the address that is associated with your solar panels? Well, wait a minute. First of all, what's the, what's the purpose of the call for the call? Well, I received a case um regarding a general question, uh, but the case does not have a question. It doesn't have information so I was trying to get more information in regards to if you know you needed anything, uh, but in order to do so I do have to verify, you know, your the these three things I have to verify the address that is associated with the account, um, your email address and your phone number just to make sure I'm speaking to Mr. Steven Barons. That's odd you're calling and went on a Saturday. Um, yeah, [REDACTED]. Mhm. Uh-huh. Um, uh, my phone number is ***-***-****. And just your email address. And what Oh, I have two of them. Sman Bay ** at gmail.com. There you go. And um the city, state and zip code of your address? ** *****. And that city state? That's in New Jersey, Audubon, Audubon, New Jersey. Got it thank you so much. Now, so um I just received this case it doesn't have a reason or anything and I just wanted to verify if if there was something that I can help you with that you were inquiring about recently or everything has been situated. Yeah Oh, got it. I think I called about * months ago. Mhm. And what was it? Do you remember what was it about or didn't, but this, this was recently. And some Had to be. Yeah, I was just. Yeah, the, the guy that sold me the panels. Mhm. Um, He had told me that Um, Let me see, he had told me that um. I would be paying my electric bill to your company and not PSE and G. And And also it turns out that I'm really not saving a whole heck of a lot of money saving a little bit. Because I, I lease these panels. Mhm. And they charged me so much per month for the for the panels. Mhm. And it comes out to probably the same amount as almost the same amount as before I even had them. So those were my questions. Hm Yes. The cost of the lease is is is almost even with what I was already paying for my electric. Um, the **.** monthly? Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Mhm, with your, with your, um, My electric bill is lower than that in the winter, but in the summers, it's, it's higher. I know. Yeah, and that's, that's, that's one of the things is, um, that, that's one of the benefits as well and you have to take into consideration, you know, the, the weather and everything. I always like to tell my customers to at least wait, um, you know, a full year to be able to grab. Ask the most information. I know it's, it's a long, it's a long term, uh, investment because you know we have customers that you know they don't produce throughout their winter months, which, you know, we are experiencing a lot of winter months right now, especially with the, you know, with the cold weather, not a lot of sun, um, and you know with summer coming up that's one of our best benefits, uh, some of our customers it diff it it's just different for everybody. I can't speak for, you know, just one person. I one of uh like just one customer but there's customers where you know they they do see the value in the system, you know, most likely summer because that's, you know, one of the best months um depending on where you know you're actually located to be able to, you know, consume all those savings and, and have your system, you know, overproduce. Now the benefits, the benefits of it, I know like, you know, in your winter months you're not gonna see a lot of benefits and, and that's because of the weather. Uh, but it is, um, still helping you feed off of the solar throughout the day because, you know, as, as you use, as you produce the energy, you know, uh, from the, the peak of the morning that you have on your, on your actual, um, solar panels. From the beginning of the morning when you, when you hit your, when you actually hit your peak, then, you know, you're, you're producing it and, and using the same energy that you're producing on a day to day basis. Now, you know, when the sun goes down, obviously you go to the grid and that's, that means, you know, it's, it's going, it's feeding off of your actual utility company. Um, and that's where you see your utility bill still being, you know, a charged because any energy that's not covered by our solar solar, then that actually gets charged by your utility company now on months that you are going going to overproduce, then you will see the credits on your utility bill um stating how much you actually sold back to the actual utility company and um it'll show it on the bill as well. It, it, it tells you. You know, from from the from the utility company to um to you and um on the bill it actually it would actually show that information uh there's gonna be months that that you you will experience, you know, a low, you know, a low production uh it all depends on weather as well and I like to tell my customers at least give it that first year. I know you just got activated back in it looks like um July. Mhm. And I, I think they also mentioned about the possibility of putting one extra panel up there. But I never got I never heard anything else about that. Yeah and that that can take um that can take place but I will let you know if you do do do an additional like system as far as even an extra panel because it's not within the first design then that will be um you know an extra not an extra but it would, it would be a different contract for that additional um those additional panels, OK. Oh, so in other words, they're gonna charge me more for adding another panel. Yeah, and, and only because you know the system is designed whenever the design team takes into consideration it takes into consideration like how many panels is your house uh going to need, how much energy are those panels going to. Um, measure on, um, you know, on a yearly basis to be able to see, you know, how, how can they design the system exactly for your home, so that's why, you know, when there's additional panels to be added then then that considers a different contract because it's it's all based off of, you know, contract by contract um I do like to be transparent with my customers I do like to give them all the information that I do contain. Because I don't want, you know, any, you know, miscommunication or, you know, an upset customer not knowing that, you know, that could possibly happen and in these cases, some, some of these cases are it's not explained and, and I do understand that, yeah. Well, yeah, but she has been done. Did not go over any of that with me, but they're up there now, so. Yeah. Um, you know, there's not much I can do about it. All right. Yeah, alright, and I just, I was just wanted to, did, did I answer all your questions and concerns? Yeah. Yes, yes.

Nobody picked up the phone and, uh, I mean I had to pay money. that's very unfair. Mhm. Mhm. Um, but I had to pay $***. Yeah, I had to pay an electrician to trigger your system. I called Connecticut Light and Power. They came and they said you gotta call an electrician. The system was, was tripping. I don't know why it tripped everything and uh. Right. OK. I don't know. I really don't know the details. All I can tell you is that I have problems with my power. I called my sales person. He did the right thing. He escalated the call, but I mean, I couldn't be without power for * days. So this happened yesterday. Yeah, nobody called back. Nobody, I mean, I, I don't know how the system, how your company operates, but there's an emergency, somebody should be able to return the calls immediately or within the same day. Right. So I had to call Connecticut Light and Power. They, they didn't want to do nothing. They didn't want to touch it because, you know, they only deal with the outside power and they, they told me to call an electrician. I had to get an electrician to come and reset everything. They had to come and, I don't know what he did, but all, all I could tell you is that they got the power back on and it cost me $*** and he said call your um. Right. Your solar company and if it trip us again, you know, because that's a problem. I mean, I'm already spending money on the system and I haven't even and your system is not charging or anything just to let you know. Mhm. It's not charging it's not that's what he said. I don't know. He said he couldn't touch that system because it doesn't go that far. All he did was reset it because it was just tripping everything. OK. So I don't know if you guys gonna reimburse me for that. I have the bill. OK. OK, yes sir. That was the reason why I was giving you the call, um, because if you already had it resolved, um, and the electrician was able to confirm that it was due to the solar panels, of course, we will reimburse you and we will need the proof of either the invoice or how you made the payment to him. Um, and if I can send you an email, if I can send you an email and if in that email you could just please reply back to it with either the invoice or any type of proof that you. Um, Mhm. Yep. Yep. OK, yep. Yep, and just send me an email and I'll send you the invoice here. OK, perfect. Yep, and also Connecticut Light and Power came by and they said they didn't wanna even touch your system. They said nope, we don't touch that. They just said you got a problem with your solar system because with your solar panels and it's stripping the, the thing so it might happen again. I don't know, um, but then then again I I'll, I'll forward you the bill because I'm not even in the country. I'm in Colombia so I could tell you that my wife had a call. She was all nervous, bent out of shape with no power. She couldn't work because we work out of. She works out of the house, so she couldn't work, so she was a little bit out of shape. Yeah, yeah, no problem. OK. OK. Oh, OK, great, sorry for this, uh, but we're trying to get it right for you.

At ATT.net. OK, perfect. All righty. So have I mentioned you can expect an email from Passage and Solar and have a mention, just reply back to it. Don't edit anything on the email, just attach the the approval, OK? And another quick question for you, of course, yes, sir. I don't wanna take too much of your time, but I just have enough. All right. You got it. You got it. OK, thank you. Mhm You, you gotta send somebody over because your system is not charging. It's not producing it's not charging. I don't know if you guys monitor that how you monitor, but you, you could send someone over to look at the system. OK, so that's what I was gonna let you know next in regards to you stating that the, the system is not charging. I actually have your production open and I'm viewing it live and I do see that it is consuming the energy. We don't have any open alerts of system issues. Mhm. It is. OK, I don't know. All I could tell you is that I, I was out of power. I'm not there. I'm in Colombia, and my wife told me she doesn't know anything about that, so I don't know. I don't have no clue how that works. So I've been here since October, so I wasn't even there when you installed the system. So I don't know if you're monitoring it and you see that it's producing, that's fine. My bill went up like outrageously. It went up to about $*** instead of going down, it went up. I'm not even consuming. I'm not even there. OK. OK. It's only one person in the household right now and the system instead of going it was going backwards. So it's actually I'm spending more, I mean consuming more electricity than I was consuming before according to the new bill I went it's higher, so I'm paying more for electricity now than I was that I was paying two months ago. OK All right. I hear you. OK, so I do see that you were active on January **, ****. Um, I do see that in Connecticut, obviously the weather, it's not obviously the warmest weather. So you were active during the cold during the cold months. So obviously it's too soon for you to even see those savings um with your electricity company. But just allow the springtime and the summertime, and you should be able to see a drastic change on, on your utility bill. Mhm, OK. Mhm. Right. Since the Yeah, no, no problem. Yep, that's fine that's fine. Yep. OK, alright, I, I think this is gonna cost me an arm and a leg because I was paying every month ** to $*** to Connecticut like, uh, to, uh, Eversource. Now my bill between yours and them. I'm gonna go up to about $***. So let's see what happens, right? I it's too soon to tell, right? OK, alright, alright, bye bye. OK, right. All right. Yes, sir.

You spoke to Ms. Nikayla and were boarded on April *st. So from that day on, you know, your, your, from the activation date on. Mm. OK Mm. On March **th of **** you've been producing on your solar system? Um Uh, what is the, what is your concerns or what is it that I'm looking at your, at your chart for the last um year and it looks like right now you're experiencing your winter months, um, but you know, come, come April, you should start going ahead and producing more than usual like last year as well. Um, I just wanted to know what are, what are your concerns as far as for your email that you sent us. Yes, uh, actually it is not a concern. It, it is just I just asked to to. For analysis, how I save on. Electricity using solar. OK, um. I mean the effectiveness, effectiveness of like changing from from just usual to solar. Yes, and I mean the usual supply. No And I get it. So the effectiveness of it is whenever you know throughout the day when you're producing your solar energy, you're also using it and that necessarily takes into place into the savings in your electricity bill. I know you do pay at least a least amount a month a month on a month to month basis for you to be able to have the panels with us now. Maybe. What And Just Yeah As far as for the savings part, you're not using, you know, as much electricity from your, from the grid that you, um, from your utility company because, you know, throughout the day you are on solar. Now your bill could be a little bit different if you weren't on solar. throughout the day you will be just on the grid and will be charged for all that energy that you're that, you know, you're not producing on your solar um under solar throughout the day. Yeah Yeah Now, if your concern is as far as savings or you feel like you're not saving or anything like that, is that what it is or is is it you were trying to just um see the concept of, you know, having solar and how is it beneficial to you? OK. Time to go to the line. Don't call me. Yes, I, I, I, I'm trying to understand if it was the right decision to do it. OK. So I need some some visuals like graphics or something that if I. If I Didn't use it. I would spend this much if I now I use it and uh I spend this less I mean something like graphs, something visuals.

2c42a07c-676b-49b6-8499-29057f75ffed,"Hello. Hi, good morning, Miss Cordelia Boy. Speaking. This is Olae with Pathogen Solar. How are you today? I'm sorry, who is this? Celeste with Posogen Solar in partnership with NYSS. OK. Um, I did, um, just, I mean we received your email intake. I wanted to go over that information, but prior to doing so I, I want to, um, can you verify the address that you're inquiring about? I'm sorry, say again, you said I know you said you're in partnership with New York State Solar, but what's the name of your firm? Possage and solar we service, yeah, we service the panels. Oh sorry, I just. Yep, yep, yep, yep. And um just before moving forward can you verify the address that we're speaking on? [REDACTED]. City to zip code? ***** City and state? Southampton, New York. Thank you, uh, bear with me, give me just a second. And then um do you have a good email address? DHgirl* at gmail.com. Got it and um your phone number? The number you just called. Can you confirm it for me please? This is ridiculous. ***-***-****. Thank you so much um and that that was just for verification issues and just making sure you know I was speaking to the correct person as well. um I would not want to give, you know, incorrect information to, you know, a stranger, but I did want to go over your email now I um I read it uh prior to performing the. And I was wanting to try and see what is the root of the problem now um you have been getting the run around and, and I see that you know, described in the email but um I wanted to see what is it that I can do to you know help you out. Well, you could fix your reporting on SolarEdge because your reporting on SolarEdge is exactly opposite than the reporting that PSCG, the utility company is giving me. OK, so is it, is it on the, uh, you're talking about their bill? So in the bill on their use diagrams, they show me how much energy I'm producing and how much energy I'm using. Mhm. Mhm. It shows regular basis that I'm using more energy that I'm producing. But if you look at SolarEdge for any given day, it says I'm producing more energy than I'm using, so which is it? OK, so, um, it sounds to me that we do need to do a bill review now. I can definitely go over that information with you now you have to take into consideration, yes, you you are overproducing. Um, if it's showing you on there on solar edge, but you have to take in consideration the, the energy that you're taking from the grid. From the grid means the the all the energy that you're using that when you're not on solar anymore. Obviously, you know, whenever the sun comes up, you know, you start producing and when the sun comes down, that energy is no longer available and anything that you overproduce gets sold back to your utility company. Now, the And Mhm. I understand all that, and that's very clear in the solar edge graph. Mhm. And in the graph there is the energy that I use from the grid, there's the energy I use from production. There's the amount of production that's going back to me, and then there's the amount of production that's going back to the utility company. The amount of production going back to the utility company almost, almost every day, depends if it's cloudy and raining, is higher than what the utility company is saying they're getting. The utility company is saying I'm using far more energy than I'm producing. And I haven't gotten a single credit from a previous month for the from the utility company, which I thought I was supposed to get. Yes. So the reporting doesn't even line up. Let's start with the reporting. OK. OK, and I totally understand what you're saying in terms of at night time where there's no sun I'm using energy off the grid. I get that. But it's also showing me a big blue line that says I made all this energy today and I don't know where it's going because the utility companies is not seeing the same thing. In the meantime, one of your colleagues by the name of Liz has asked me to send ** months of bills in which I did the other day, and I also sent you to the two graphs, one that shows the positgen energy produced and one that shows PSE energy produced, and they show exactly the opposite. And I sent her that information a couple of days ago. I haven't heard anything back so I don't know if you're looking at the same information or not. Um, no, I'm actually not. I'm looking at the email intake that was sent to, to me, um, but I can just double check. Give me a second if I'm able to get that information from where you've been talking to Liz. Give me a moment. Let me check that out on my end. Let me see, give me a second. Let me put you on a brief hold, OK, bear with me. You're totally breaking up. I'm sorry, say again. Oh, I'm I'm sorry, can you hear me now? Yeah Let me put you on a brief hold. Uh, I said bear with me, OK? OK great thank you. Thank you. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold.

You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. Uh, thank you for holding, Ms. Boy. So I just, you know, given, you know, the situation and everything, and I do see that, you know, you've been trying to get in contact with us regarding the, the situation, but I did want to inform you now. Um, like I stated, uh, it would be good to go over a bill review. I know you sent that information to Elizabeth. Now if she hasn't responded, then I would, you know, wait on her response, but because. She's already working on it, but what I would tell you, what I would tell you about the metering with um with PSEG that they only send you their, their meter reading. They don't send you, you know, all the information that we do have, so I would suggest, you know, waiting on the information that um that Elizabeth, you said Elizabeth, correct? Elizabeth was gonna send you after reviewing list, um, after reviewing your information because you know. Liz, yeah. Uh, that's all they're gonna send you. They're gonna send you the meter reading only because, you know, they're not connected to all the information that we do have, uh, especially Solar Edge or any of our other monitoring access that we have as employees, um, but I would suggest you wait on her response, um, and see, uh, because obviously she's going over that information already, but, um. That that's the only thing I can tell you in regards to the meter, um, because they, they don't send you exactly, you know, what you're using or or or anything like that, uh, any solar related besides what you're selling back to them and what you're using from them, um, but. OK, that's my point. My point is what you're saying I'm sending back to them, they're not, they're saying they're not getting that. Mhm. So how could that possibly be? How could it possibly be that you say I'm making up numbers here, I'm sending back ** kilowatts and they're saying they got *. How could that be? OK, so. That makes no sense. OK, so the sell back, um, how it works is that. And that's the reason why, why I'm saying, you know, wait till this it gives you a call back only because now uh what PSEG is getting is their, their own metering that's connected they that's their meter, um, we, that's the same meter that that um. You know, measures the amount that we, that, that, that the solar energy is producing selling back. Now, there's no way we can, you know. Change, you know, change that information and it'd be different on the system unless we're not, you know, communicating correctly and seeing what is it as far as the amounts are are correct, what is it that you're using off the grid, what is it that you're using uh while you're on solar so that's what that's the reason why I'm saying that because as far as the metering it, it's coming from them the meter, that's the meter that PSEG put in place to be able to read that information. I, I, you know what I I hear what you're saying but I don't understand is my question. Yeah. What was that? I said I hear what you're saying. I don't understand how that answers my question. OK, and I do understand um I mean I I I understand your frustration, but like I stated I would wait on list to give you a call back in regards to your question um I get these email intakes and you know if they're already being worked on by somebody else then you know that information is sent by them and you get a response by them directly um I was, you know, I was assigned to your case today and I was trying to get, you know. Um, a solution to it, but it looks like Liz is already working on it. OK, can I ask one more question, and that is, is it thing that Liz has done and everything that I've sent in, is that on your CRM? Do you guys have access? Do you have access to that as well, or is that just sitting on Liz's desk at this point? Yes. On the same um the CRM as in as in our portal that we're able to see. Yeah, you're a customer portal, you know that I've called a gazillion times. You know that I kind of information. I'm just kind of wondering if um. Yeah. If all that information is, you know, all the bills that I sent in the charts that I sent in, I'm just kind of wondering if that's all. Um, in your portal. OK, and then not that that information won't be in the portal like it'll be in your case but not in the portal but I can check, um, let me see, give me a second. Let me check on my on the portal that the employees have. Give me a second. And do you need it for um for what? I don't, I just wanna make sure that you know that I don't get **** calls to go through this, and I understand that New York State still look you, and I just wanna make sure that the information I sent in, you guys have it. I don't have to go through the story with like, you know, the next person who calls me, that's all. Yeah. OK. I've wasted so much time trying to figure out what's going on. It's giving me an answer. It's just beyond frustrating. And I'm wasting time. My time is money. It's just, I don't wanna go through this all the time, that's all. No, it's OK. I, I completely understand. I have your I have your, um, production since October I mean I'm sorry, in October, August. I have your production for August all the way through right now, you know, March is still not a full month, but it does have the production that was reported from the *st of March to the *th of March to yesterday's date. Um, if you want me to send you this information I can send you this information. No, I have it. I have it. It's all on, it's all on Solaridge. I have it all. Oh OK. I just wish I just wish it would marry up with the data from. But yeah. So let me just give you an example. Hold on a second. I think I can do this. Hold on. Mhm. So if I look at February. Mhm. February says. That I donated. Solar EEdge says I donated for the month of February. *** kilowatts. That's what went back to the grid says * grid turquoise, OK? Mhm Mhm. The utility company? Say that I donated *** kilowatts. Yeah. How could that be? Oh So you. It makes OK. So you fed *** kilowatts to the grid. I said I said *** kilowatts to the grid ** according to SolarEdge, the chart I'm looking at, **% of my total production went to the grid, the grid being *** kilowatts. It's the little turquoise spar. But yet when I look at my utility bill and I go into my metering for February, which was February *st to March *st, it's showing ** kilowatts, *** kilowatts. Mhm. OK. Like, it makes no sense. Alright, and what I'm gonna let me go ahead and give you a call back. I put this information in, uh, because I don't have access to Solar Edge, um, well, give me a second, let me see, bear with me. Let me, let me try to get on solar edge right now as we speak. Bear with me. Let me see. OK, let me, OK, so let me go ahead and put you on a brief hold. I'll be right back, OK? Let me try. Thank you.

Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Yes, can you hear me? Now I can, yeah. OK, so as far as for your, for your, so I went ahead and just confirm this information on here for example. Because I was looking at your. I'm sorry you're breaking up again. Can you hear me? Um, it's in and out right now. Uh, can you hear me a little bit better? Yes. OK, so just by reviewing your, your whole, you know, production and everything because for the month. For the month of February, for example, you produce the *** kilowatts. Oh, you're breaking up again. Hello? Yes, I'm here. Can you hear me? OK, now I, I, yeah, it's going in and out. I don't know why. Try again. I'm sorry, so for the month of February, what? So for the month of February you produce *** kilowatts correct um and that's showing on on my chart you produced *** kilowatts now based off. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. For the month of February, *** and ** OK, approximately, yeah, all right. OK, so it's the *** kilowatts. Now, on your bill, you know, you know where it shows that you only um sold back * kilowatts for the month of February to the, to, to your utility company. It's, it's * kilowatts. Does it show with a number * there? I'm not looking at the bill right now. I I was looking at the dashboard, but I had to shut off my computer. I gotta go. So is there something specifically you wanted me to look at on on the bill or on the dashboard? You know, I was trying to, I was trying to explain to. Uh, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. Hello. That's better. I don't know why it keeps going in and out, sorry. No, my signal is is great. I can hear you perfectly. It's, it's probably the signal. Probably on my end, but yeah, just going, I just wanted, don't wanna miss anything, so go ahead, say again. Yeah. OK, yeah, I was just, um, trying to connect, but so basically you're. You know what, I, ma'am, I'm sorry, I can't hear you and I have to go. I've been on this call with you for ** minutes. I'm sorry, I have to go. So do you have an if you have an answer or an explanation, can you just email me, please? OK. No problem. OK, and Liz is going to contact you directly um I went ahead and messaged her as well, OK? OK. OK, I appreciate it, but if you have any insights, um, if you could email me directly, that'd be great just because I have to go and I can't really hear you. Thank you.

I am in partnership with Power Energy Solutions and a customer care team lead here. And so. OK. Um, have I caught you at a good time, sir? I can talk. OK. Thank you so much. And how are you doing today? OK. All right. That's wonderful to hear. Um, I was reaching out to you, sir, because, um, I know that our team gave you a call about maybe a month ago and let you know the system was activated and was reviewing the lease agreement. Um, it looks like a copy of the lease agreement was sent to you, um, specific, specifically because you were told by the representatives of, um, the partner there that there would be an escalator of every * years. Yeah years later. missing *. You. Correct. OK. Have you had a chance to go over the lease agreement, Mr. David? I scanned, I scanned it briefly, um, I had pulled up on my computer, but my computer's been on a glitch, so I gotta decide if I'm gonna buy, well, I can do it on my phone, but it's just harder to read. Oh, I'm sorry. So it's just a matter of either buying a new laptop or getting this one repaired so. OK. OK. OK. Um, so I wanted to just follow up with you and see if there were any additional questions that you had, if, if that, if this is something that I can go over with you. Yeah. Yeah, well, what you sent me, is it showing a * year thing or a * year thing? Um, let's see here. So let me go and pull up the agreement. They All right. All right, so it is with Power Energy Solutions. Um, the, it is a ** year agreement and it's a *.* escalator each year. Any Now, see, she even, she even wrote it down on a piece of paper by * years what it would go up every * years. OK. I mean she wrote it down by per Batum by year. You know, starting when it turned on for * years, then an escalator for * years, and another escalator for * years. And she even showed us what the final payment would be * years from now, um, like ** years from now. Do you, mhm. Alright, so And she's like, OK, I sent you the contract just sign it and send it back to me. She was like very. I would say forceful but pushy. Mhm. They all like she came in like, oh I'm gonna be your best friend, but then I found, she actually stole stuff from my house. When she came here one day. Oh. And uh the company had a the company replaced everything but. What did Um, and I'm still waiting. They're supposed to take a tree down a year ago. I'm still waiting for the tree to come down. OK. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Um, I, I am at the point, I, I, I've told numerous people I'm ready for that, I would prefer for him to just take everything off my house and leave it back the way it was because I am so dissatisfied with this company. It, it took almost * months for him to get my system working. Mhm. You know, and I paid numerous, you know, my bill's gone up twice since they promised me to come here and, and do the, I mean they were fast. They were out like in a week and do the roof and the, the solar, but then everything after that just drag on and on and on. OK. Mhm. Mhm. And they told me they couldn't do the tree until the solar was active. OK, so now the solar is active for a month and they still like. I'm still waiting for them to tell me what they're gonna do about the tree. OK, OK. I, I just wanna address a couple of things here and again, I, I do apologize for all the trouble that you had. Um, so we are in partnership with them, but we have assumed all rights and obligations and responsibilities of the lease. Um, we are in communication with Power Energy Solutions. Do you happen to remember the name of the sales rep that you were in communication with? If you Uh, give me a second. I just had it on my, um. Oh jeez, I can't think of it right now. Hold on, let me see if I have it in my phone. I think I do. OK. OK. Yes, take your time, sir. Well you know what? I just saw a business card on acid refrigerator. Let me see if it's hers. OK. No, this isn't hers. Alright, let me look at my contact list real quick. Hold on. OK, yes. Take your time, sir. OK, her name was Stephanie Money, which is a little odd, but that's what I have it in. That That's what I have it in my phone under. OK. Stephanie, um, Money MO mhm. But I know NY yes. M O N U Y. OK. OK. All right. Well, I have it as spelled as regular money, but I'm not sure if that's actually her last name. I don't know why I have it in there like that if it wasn't, if that's not what she gave me. OK, OK, yeah. Do you, did Miss Stephanie happen to give you a copy of her notes of what she wrote down there that it would go up every * years only? No, because she said she had to go and, you know, go over it with her supervisor. And she took everything she had with her. Mhm. OK. All right. All right. Now, um, OK, I, I, mhm. But uh both myself and my wife were there and went over it with her. So I mean it's, why would I find something that's gonna go up every year and it's gonna surpass what I'm paying. OK. And how are your electricity bills looking now? Um, I'm still paying electric. Like I said, I don't even know what, I don't have any way to check what my system's putting out. Yeah. OK. I know other people, they got apps that they can, can trace everything that the system's doing. Mhm. I asked for it and I get nothing. Well, that I can. I get no, I, I, I've dealt with like * or * different people from the solar company. And everybody's like, oh, I'm in charge now, I'm in charge now. I'll make sure everything's taken care of. And then they disappear. Mhm. OK, well, I can definitely assist you with that today, Mr. David. Um, can I verify, is your email david Mormac@comcast.net? Correct. OK, I can actually send you access so you can see how your system is producing. And I'll send that over to you. Now is that like an app I download or? No, it's not an app. It's, it's actually our Posgen um portal, our customer portal, so you can see how much the system is producing. You can also pay your bill. We have plenty of savings tips on the portal as well. Like OK. OK. OK, and I sent that over to you. Now, I do want to speak very confidently about the system that you have, Mr. David. Um, it is a *.* kilowatt system. Um, I do see that the system was activated in December of ****. So it actually turned on in around the time of the year where during the winter months, there's not much production. Yeah However, the production of the solar system, meaning producing electricity feeding into your home, is expected to increase. Um, the good thing about, do you have any questions about that? OK No, uh, well, I don't know if it was a show that it was producing because for two months they kept telling me they couldn't that that they couldn't turn my system on. They had to send somebody out to rewire something and. Mhm. Uh, and like, I don't know, like they would just show up at my house and start doing something. Right. Yes, so we did verify that the system was operational. It turned on December **th. Um, we actually And I'd have to go back to some of my text to that date and see if that's exactly when they said they were having problems with it. Mm OK OK. Now, on January **rd, um, when we, we took over the account, we did verify that the system was working and operational, but if you don't mind, can I place you on a brief hold just to just to confirm, just to make sure that there isn't anything else going on. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. OK, thank you so much. No problem. You are on hold. All right. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. Hello, Mr. David. Yes. Thank you for patiently holding, sir. Um, I am looking at your system production. It uh it is actually working, yes. Well looking at. OK. Yes, the system is working and producing, um. It's, it's working very, very well. Yeah Alright. Now, I, I was able to send over access so you can see your production. Did, have you had a chance to check your email? I saw it on the email but I gotta register and everything so I don't wanna do it while talking to you. I'd end up losing. OK. No, yes, that is perfectly fine. You can definitely take your time. Um, so, while I have you here on the phone, I do want to explain, um, your system. It is a *-kilowatt system which in a year, we are expecting that system to produce at about **,*** kilowatts. So we do have a year one savings guarantee that um with this system, you are guaranteed to save. So we guarantee that you will save money on your energy costs during the first year agreement, including throughout the ** year agreement, there is a production guarantee. Um, after a year from the activation date, if we determine in reasonable discretion that your combined electricity cost is greater than your electricity costs without solar, we will credit your account for the difference or provide additional energy efficiency services at no additional cost to you, sir. So we do promise that in the lease agreement here, um, there are ways that we can help customers save. I OK. OK, so this, I just wanted to, to speak about the system. You have a * kilowatt system and I've been in the solar industry for a minute now, and I can guarantee you that these systems produce at a very remarkable rate. Customers do typically save. What happens during the winter time. OK Yeah. Exactly It's because there's not a lot of sun out and we actually lose the sun hours very early in the day, then we do buy a little bit more from the utility company, from the grid. However, I believe daylight savings hours is gonna change tomorrow when we move and spring forward. and we Right. Yeah. Right. When we spring forward, we're gonna have more daylight, we're gonna have more sun, and so, mhm. OK Well, we don't get more daylight. We just get the daylight shift in an hour. We still get the same amount of daylight from sunup to sundown. Right, right. Yeah, and so what I do see here is that you have PSCNG. PSCNG is really phenomenal about recognizing um accounts that have solar, and when you have a net meter on your home, so as we have more sun out, you're gonna push back PSCNG's energy. You're gonna push it back to them. Yeah OK. Um, they will either bank and hold what you return to them, or they will deduct what you would have bought from them at a lesser amount, meaning if you bought **** kilowatts and you return to them um *** kilowatts, they would only charge you ***. Yeah. So that's how PSCNG works with solar. Um, just keep in mind that they don't have access to view your solar production. What PSNG does is only collects what you return back to them. OK. Yes, yes, but um it, it is a yearly escalator because we are expecting the system to produce, causing your utility, your electric bill to come down, and so it's, it's worth the value. Well, I'm gonna see if my wife has any of that paperwork. Um, hopefully she did leave it to her with her, but I don't recall that she did. OK. Um, what I can do is, you know, uh, I just, I wanted to just clear all of that up for you and just speak very confidently about the solar system and the escalator is a guarantee, you know, as the, as your electricity bill starts going down. um, the escalator is there in the lease agreement. However, we do guarantee in the lease agreement the year one savings. If you find after a year that you have not saved, please give us a call. But I can say for a * kilowatt system, uh, we are expecting it to produce at about **,*** plus according to the lease agreement here. Typically, these kind of systems that are * kilowatt as we start getting more sun. Um, I always see them overproduce. I always see them overproduce more, but I can definitely let Power Energy Solutions know, hey, this was, this was not a great communication to the customer from initial, um, and address that inquiry there. OK OK. OK. All right. um, Mr. David, and so you do have the link. If you have any further questions, I would like for you to give us a call. Um, you can also ask for me. My name is Gabby. Um, I am the customer care team lead here at Posagen. Yeah, yeah, actually I was just going through some. Old voicemails and I came across yours and I just didn't think you'd be in the office today otherwise I was gonna call you this morning. I was waiting until Monday so I'm glad you reached out to me. I think in the beginning my my phone has this. Oh, that's OK. Thing from AT&T that blocks a lot of calls I guess coming from. Like telemarketers, so I'll probably looked at your number as a telemarketer and so I'm getting blocked a lot so I unblocked it. Yeah. Yeah, it And I think that we actually finally got through to each other. And that's, that's OK. That's perfectly fine. I know that our phone number kind of come across as a Louisiana prefix number, like either a *** or *** number, um, but we are calling from a call center, so it does appear that way to our customers, but, um, I would like to provide, if it's OK with you, I can email you our phone number and my contact information and if you have any other issues, you know, please feel free to give us a call. call center. I. Mhm OK. OK. All right, Mr. David. And just one final last question. Are you satisfied with the level of service I've given you today? OK. Yes. Well, other than I got the problem with the contract. OK. But that's out of your hands also. OK. Yeah, uh, we do guarantee, you know, the savings and whatnot, um, and we do guarantee of that electricity output. And OK All right, Mr. David. Well, it was a pleasure speaking with you today. I hope you have a wonderful day, sir, and a great weekend. Alright. Thank you very much, Gaby. You're welcome. You have a great weekend bye.

Um, initially when the leaks were put up and then they sent a crew back out. Mhm. To come and fix what whatever it was. OK. And then I thought it was OK because it looked like it was there, but I guess because it was already there, but we're noticing it to get bigger. OK. But the problem is the attic is all new. OK.

I'm gonna go ahead and stop your payments and then also I'm gonna go ahead and offer you a non-cash credit. Basically for the months that you have paid that your system has been down, it will be applied to your postage and account. You wouldn't make a payment until the credit runs out, which it will be for about * months. Um, I do have to send you a settlement agreement form which it includes the amount of the credit that's going to be applied to your account. This is just for your records and also our records of the credit that's being applied to your account. Um, is it OK if I send you the, the settlement agreement form? OK. OK. OK. Yes, ma'am, please.

So you can be expecting an email from me um later, later today because I do have to work on it in order for me to apply the credit and then whenever you have time, you can just read over it, sign it, and I do receive a notification once you signed it so I can apply it to your account. But first, we will need the signatures from you, OK? OK. All righty, Mr. Steven. In the meantime, is there anything else that I can assist you with today? Yes ma'am. That's it.

Um, let me go ahead and take a look into your case. Bear with me here. Mhm. OK, so we, the reason why we're trying to reach out to you is because we wanted to know um what is going on with the home because we do see that the system is not producing or reporting and we will need to know if there's anything that we can do in regards to the power being restored. I don't know. I'm not in the house right at the moment. I'm having, it's being redone because there was a fire last year. On April **th. OK. Mhm. And they were doing regular inspections. So, um, somehow or another, the electric company came out because they wasn't sending me my bills, and they took the electric um thing off, the electrical box in the back, on the outside. And Mhm. They took that. So, They wrote me and told me that they, I wasn't gonna get any more electric until I paid the bill. So I paid the bill, so obviously they turned the electric back on, but I don't know whether or not the solar panels were attached to that box or what, but I know my electric bills have been extremely high. OK. OK. OK. Well, let me go ahead and do this. Let me go ahead and take a look into the production, um, because it does have to be connected to the inverter box in order for the energy to be sent back to the electricity company. If it's not connected, then it's not gonna be sending, uh, yes, if it's not connected, it's not gonna be sending anything back. Yes, and it's gonna be causing you to have that high electricity bill. Um, but let me go ahead and take a take a look. Um, Then that's what it is, yeah. Yeah, and you know what else happened too? Hold on, before you got, they also stole the electrical wires out of my house and the box on the inside so that I think that's been repaired too. Mhm. Oh wow, OK. So, Yeah, um, I don't know when you guys would be able to get back in there to. hook it back up on the inside. OK. Um, I don't know. Don't worry. Let me go ahead and take a, let me go ahead and take a look first so that way I can confirm that the system is not connected. Bear with me here. I had the guy. Thank you, thank, thank, thank you so much cause I was wondering and I didn't know who to call and ask was it still connected or not? OK, so if, if you find out anything or you need to let let me know, just text me or you call me and I'll call, I'll get back to you. Right, OK, no worries. Right, I understand. OK. So actually, I have the ability to check right now while I have you on the line because I have the ability to view remotely.

After doing my investigation, I can confirm with you that the solar system is not connected, so basically it's not on, so you're not saving anything um with the solar panels, and that's the reason you've been receiving the high bills. Um, but that's why the last agent was trying to contact you so that way we can get confirmation if the power was already restored in the home, so that way we can have a technician go out there again and reconnect the reconnect the wiring. Oh, that's OK. Oh, OK. OK. Mhm. In the box. OK. OK. All righty. And Ms. Denise, let me ask you, when was the power restored on the home? OK. I don't know. See, the point is they I got temporary living arrangements somewhere else, so I'm not down there. Right, OK. And I'm not in the um I'm not actually in the house. I they they I have people going in there and they go in there as the insurance company pays them. And so I don't know when they're in there and when they're not. Oh, OK. OK. Well, thank you so much for the additional information. That's why it's so hard, yeah. Mhm. I am so sorry. It's, it's hard to keep track of everything that's going on when you're not, you're not right there on the premises and you have to be somewhere else while they, while they're fixing your house. And then people go in and steal your electrical wires and your piping. Right. Oh wow. Wow, that is extremely hard. Yes, I am so sorry that you're going through this, Miss Denise. I am, I'm really sorry. It's hard. Mhm. That's OK, it'll work out. Things are gonna work out. Of course, yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, of course. Look, I got a call from you guys today to tell me why the electric is so high. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Oh, that bill is $***. I was like, where, where, where, where's my solar? Right. Yeah, it's because it's not on, but I'm glad that now we know that the power has been restored. I was only asking if you knew when was it restored, um, so that our technicians can have a better understanding, um, but if not, it's completely OK. I'm pretty sure they will figure it out, um, so that way they can go ahead and send someone out to reconnect the wiring for the solar panels. Mhm. Oh, OK. All right. Thank you. Of course, Mr. Denise. All righty. Yes, ma'am, of course. Um, do you happen to have any other questions or anything that you want me to clarify for you? Thank you. Mhm. Uh uh. All righty, Ms. Denise.

5a271eb8-9c65-4410-ac35-013ac2be94f5,"Hello? Hi, good morning, Mr. Peter Watson. This is Celeste with Pathogen Solar. How are you today? Yes. Hello? Um, I don't know. Are you calling to give me good news or not? Well, I'm actually calling to get more information um so uh hopefully it's good news, but I did want to just verify a few things with you prior to, you know, discussing more information. um, can you go ahead and verify the address associated with the account that you um said. Go ahead. * Mhm. [REDACTED]. City, state and zip code? Uh, this is Port Murray, New Jersey *****. Thank you and then just verify your phone number for me please too. ********** Thank you so much and then just one more thing, your email address. Alright. My full name is Peter, the initial V Watson, no doubt that is a face. Mm. OK, and that is at um is it yahoo, gmail. Gmail.com. Yeah. OK, Gmail, got it. And then, um, thank you so much. So I was just going over your email intake that you sent over now. um, the only thing that I got and that's why I'm trying to get more information is, um, I'm gonna read it to you. It says I have been trying to get this information from multiple representatives since February *th. Um, it says that Ryan Maxells no longer with Pothogen Rich Sony by. I assume so because I can't find them. OK, um, no, he's still here and then it says not getting anywhere. This was promised right from the beginning with Ryan Mack. Now I don't have a description. Oh, hold on a second. Hold on a minute. Ryan Mack is still with you? Mm yeah. Ryan Mack is still with Hagen. Yes, he should still be there. OK. I have, I have, he has never called me back. And I assumed he wasn't there anymore cause he hasn't called me, he hasn't texted me. I'm using the same text he communicated with me before, and he has that zero communication with me at all. And also, I, um, Mhm. I tried to use the app to to refer people to him and he Mhm. Is not on your list of provider of um sales people anymore. OK, give me a second, let me, I could just check, bear with me. So that's a an issue right there. Yeah, no, it's, it's no, so he is, you're right, you're right, that's my mistake. No, he's not, um, I am looking for him here on my end, but no, he's not, um, so that's the reason for the call. I was trying to see, you know, because there's no description of the issue here in this email that I received by you, um, and I was trying to go in depth on what's what's going on and, and what, what is it? Mhm. Well, that's not really the problem. It's the reason why it's not been fixed efficiently, but that's not really the actual problem. Mhm and what is the issue? Yeah Um, I've been trying to get the app since it was activated, February *th. Mhm. What application depositing application? Yeah, so that I can see what my generation is. Mm. Not been able to see my generation is insane. And I don't understand why, with all the phone calls, all the people that called me, everything that happened, why this isn't something that is just automatically crazy. You would think it should be. OK, and, and I can let you know the reason why exactly why haven't you received that information. So, um, me looking at your boarding call, it does look like they've tried to get a hold of you on the *th of the. OK. No. No, no, there's no way in heck. I am available on phone calls, email, text. Please, don't insult me by saying that. I want name and phone numbers. If you're telling me people's trying to get me, I want a list of names, phone numbers, times and dates because I am very busy. I get calls from everybody. So please, don't insult me by saying they've been trying to get hold of me. Not happening. Let's move on to the reason why. And Yeah. And I, I'm very sorry you're you, you feel that way, but I'm not trying to make you feel that way. I'm just giving you the information that is here on file for the onboarding team. Bye. They're lying. They're lying. Names, phone numbers and dates and times. No one's tried to get hold of me. No one's. Yes, and I'll give you that information. Yes sir, and I'll just give you that information. This just happened yesterday. I will give you names. I will give you times, and I will give you um the reason why you still haven't received the policy and application, um, access. So on the *rd, on the *rd we've got the, the person which is Ali, that's our onboarding specialist for your specific. Mhm. Good, go for it. Oh, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Her name was what? I really. Could you spell that for me, please? A R E L I. And she's an onboarding person, and when did she try to contact me? Yes, so what happened? On the *th. No, it didn't happen, but anyway, all right, go ahead. Yeah. Yesterday, the *th at **:** in the morning is Oh, No, no. Anyway, all right, go ahead, keep going. At she first she first attempted to leave a voicemail. Now this is. Uh, what phone number? And to the one that you just verified ***-***-**** that's the phone number that. Hold on one second. **:** yesterday morning? Yes, sir. You with me? I'm here. Hello? Yeah, no, she's lying. I had messages in here **:** and **:**, and I have some before that, did not call me. Messages or calls, calls? Anyway, so let's go ahead. I can, I can, I, I can send you the screenshot where she called you, um, but, uh, again, um, there's, there's no. But, but, so she called me once at **:**. I did not get the call. I did, there was no message left and there was no email, no follow-up phone call. All right. So let's move beyond that. OK. So let me tell you, so how it works, sir, so whenever we, we get the first voicemail, I mean, um, whenever we call you, we try to call you * times, right? We haven't because she just got your account. So what happens with these boarding cases we get your information, we make sure we call the customer as soon as we get the information and then we call you. So the first attempt was yesterday. She left a voicemail and it is the number that we're speaking into now, the ***-***-****. Mhm. OK. So what happens is if you don't answer we leave a voicemail. The *nd attempt, if you don't answer we leave a voicemail if it's available and we send a text message. Now the *rd time when we get a hold of you, we call you, we leave a voicemail, and if you don't answer we still send an email. The *th attempt we call you, leave a voice. Smell and if you don't answer then we still print out a paper where it says *th attempt and we've already finalized all of our our our attempts to be able to get a hold of you and then after we go ahead and mail out that that information and have you reach out to us once that once all * attempts have been exceeded. Now it looks like it's just her first attempt um I do. Great. So what was she calling to tell me? Let's assume she got me on the phone. Let's assume I didn't get the messages, and let's assume that since February *th, I've been attempting to get this information, which is why I'm really upset with part of that. So what's the answer to the question? Mhm. Yes, and And I do understand that. I do understand that you've been trying to get that information so how it works and I'm sorry it's not explained and I'm sorry we don't have, you know, something to explain to our customers, hey, you know this is, you know, the step by step situation, but once you get boarded, uh, we get all your information we call you, we let you know, hey, um, what she was trying to call you to let you know is that you have an *. you have a * kilowatt system, you have ** panels, the system. Right. Activation date was February **th of ****. You do have a ** year agreement of monthly payment of $**.** with a $*.** escalator. The first eight months you're paying $*. You do have a promotion. So the first eight months, month by month, is $* for the *st * months. Now she does have your drafting information. It looks like you have a Mastercard on the *st of every month. And um you do she she put in your your email address which is Peter V Watson@gmail.com and there's no additional notes she was calling you to let you know that at the time that we do perform that boarding call. Uh, we, what we do is we can't send that information for the, for the postage and portal only because we have to get a hold of you first. Once we get a hold of you just like today, we, I verified your phone number, your address, your email address, and your mailing, well, also your mailing address, we make sure everything is correct. That way we can be able to send that portal um link to you to be able for you to be able to set up your password and have access to the customer portal so once you have access to the customer portal you're able to you're you're still not gonna be able to see your production only because and I will explain why. You have to wait the first, you know, the first billing cycle to be able to log back in because it is a month by month production um portal and you're able to see month by month. So once the first month becomes available to you, you can log back in and you'll see your full month's production on there. Now that's the reason why you haven't um gotten you know any access to the customer portal because that's that's how it works once we get your account we go over we go over all this information. It does take time for us to be able to, you know, get in contact with the customer, verify the information and send it over to you now right now that we already verified that information, what I'm going to do, I'm going to message Ali. I'm gonna let her know that I've spoken to you already right now. I will. Go ahead and um attempt to send you the portal that way you will log in, change your password to whatever password it is that you wanna set it up to and have access to the customer portal so um I don't want you to go through any more you know more headaches. I want you to have the correct information and that's all I want, you know, as far as my end as far as my customer service, I want you to have a good service, um, so give me just a second. So what I'm going to do. OK. And your login, so your login typically is for your, for your login um is going to be your email and then it's going uh and let me see, give me a second. Bear with me. Your login is going to be your email, your full email, and then after your email, just, you know, after the dot com you're gonna place the *. So the *, what it means is the, the, the numerical number of your address. So you're your login. I've already sent that the customer portal link you set that up when I ask you for a log in it's gonna be Peterv Watson@gmail.com * after the.com, OK? You're able to set that up and then you know once that is done, um you will be able to. To go ahead and um check back in ** days to see your production. So, well, hold on a second, so the This log on I'm gonna use all the time is gonna be Peter B. Watson at gmail.com. All right? And then I'm gonna create this password. Mhm. Mhm. Yes, exactly. So And in a month from now that will show me the month by month but. Yes. OK. So number one, all the stuff that you said that you had to verify. Mhm. Mhm. was done multiple times during the last * months. Mhm. You guys had all this because not only did I sign contracts, but also you guys sent me all this information that had to get signed and sent back and notarized for the inspections for the township for the drawings so you guys have had all the information you just asked me to confirm all along. So on February **th. It's actually February *th when this actually went out. I understand it takes time. So let's say on February **th, you had all the information already to activate this portal and send me an email with the same link that you just sent me now. Mhm. Because you've already confirmed all this, otherwise you wouldn't have been able to install the system because I wouldn't have been able to sign the contract. So number one, that's a really good way of doing business. Number *, month by month month isn't gonna help. Because as you guys are aware, but you're probably not. Jersey Central only allowed us to put in an * kilowatt system when it should have been attained. The circuit breaker outside is only **. The panels may or may not be generating ** amps. My car, which you had the VIN number for and everything before this even was written, which is what I talked to Ryan Mack about, my car charges at ** amps. Mhm. I bought another new car which Ryan Mack was aware of because he made me give you the VIN numbers and everything for that. And I gave that VIN number multiple times to different people over the phone and email and text touyen since we weren't able to find him. That *nd car also charges the system, which brings the amperage up even higher. I need to know what posigen is generating because you're guaranteeing me the ** amps. It's an * kilowatt system. So as of right now, we don't know if it's generating * kilowatt, * kilowatts, or * kilowatts. We have no way of knowing. I need the app to tell me that. And I know you guys have it because otherwise you wouldn't be able to test your systems. So I need that app, not the one you wanna give me, not this portal. I need to know. As it's functioning, what it's generating, or it's gonna be useless. Mhm Mhm Now, do you understand my request? I've asked probably * different people to get me. Yes, I do understand. So now as as. Good. So let's focus on that because we know that your service crew has it. We know that the service crew uses it because they've got to confirm the panels and everything. So now you need to get me access to that app. OK, so unfortunately the only app that we have for our customers is the month by month one. Now that's a brand new app that was given. That I don't, I don't care. I, I really truly don't care. That's useless to me. I need something that's gonna show me the generation. I need to know that you guys have given me what you contracted for. And we don't know that. You don't know that. But your company does, cause someone's got that app. So, like I stated, we only have the one that was given to you. I, what I can do. No, you don't. You don't, you don't. Your service crew has this. I know they have it. I need access to see what I'm generating. OK. And I. OK? That's what I need. And and I do understand that um uh like I said I'm I'm trying to explain um all this information so how it works is that's that's the new one that was given right the month by month one. So if there's any other one that I'm not aware of, I will verify with you, but we do have the one for for the employees to see. Great. Mhm. Live and see a day by day, month by month, year by year. We do have us as employees, we do have that one. I do understand your frustration and I do understand that you're trying to track your production as a customer. I would too if I was in your shoes. Now, if there's any other portal that I'm not aware of. I can just double check, but there's only the portal that is that shows month by month and that's our brand new one that we got so let me put you on a brief hold and let me see and try to find out if there's any other portal. If not, that would be just the only one that we provide you with and if you want a day. Uh Mm By day, month by month, yes, of course, as as employees we're able to print that out and send it over to you email it to you any time you request that you do have rights to that it is your system now I know you're frustrated because you're not able to see it yourself as a customer, but let me just double check. I don't want you to, you know, go through any more, you know, headaches or anything like that. Alright. Well, two things while you're checking on that. Number one, the site that you gave me that I logged into and changed my password on is only a beta version, it's still under testing, which is fine. I can make comments or data about bugs and stuff. OK. Um, and then the other part of it is if you can't give me access to that. Mhm. Mhm. And you're gonna send a print out to me? Yes, I can Then you're gonna have to send the print out for every minute. Of every day since the **th of February. To every minute it doesn't uh we don't have an every minute one, but we do have uh a daily one and that's the, the one that I have access to. No, I need to know what it's generating hour by hour. The day doesn't help, right? Because we know the sun comes up at a certain time. We know it's generating a certain amount of power at certain points during the day, and we know that some days are cloudy, some days are sunny. I need to know when I'm gonna charge my car. I need to know when to plan to charge my car, when to set the charging rate, and what to set the charging rate at, at what time of day. Mhm. So if you need to mail me something, you're gonna have to do a printout that shows me what the generation is from the time the sun comes up to the sun to the time the sun goes down. Constantly during the day, every minute, every * minutes, every ** minutes, starting on February **th. That's what you're gonna have to email to me. You're gonna have to stay on mail. You can email it to me. But that's what I'm gonna need. If you can't give me access to the app, you're gonna have to do that. Probably I would think at least for the first few months, you're gonna have to do it weekly. OK, so. Oh, daily, I don't care. Um, I can't make any promises on the, on the second by second, minute by minute. I do know that we have access to to the day by day one. So and in, in the day by day one it actually shows you the peak and the the peak times, which is the peak that it starts and which is the peak that it finishes, but not. Mhm. Yeah, well. Go ahead and send it and we'll see, uh, once you checked out whether or not you can get access to the app or not. Uh, and if you cannot, then you'll go ahead and send that to me and we'll see if it's sufficient for what I need. OK, give me a second, bear with me, uh, let me put you on a brief hold, OK? Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold.

You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. OK, thank you, Mr. Watson for holding um and being patient. So I, OK, so yes, um there that's the only access the portal access that you that our customers get the month by month one, but what I can do is exactly what you requested so I went ahead and um got the information from the production. No problem at all. And that you have, have um produced since you you since you've been activated and I'm going to, is it a tech I mean are you fine with text message are you fine with emails? I could send you a text. You're probably better off emailing it because then you can bookmark it and you can give the information to whomever so that they can continue to do this on an ongoing basis. You know. OK, bear with me. Cause without an app, it's gonna have to be ongoing, unfortunately. Yes, I, I completely understand. Give me a second. Yeah. Alrighty, um, is there, I went ahead and sent the email. It's about it, it should take no less than * minutes to receive, um, and I will put it on here that you want a month by month, uh, report, I'm sorry, not month by month, but like, um, you want it consistently and then that way you have that information because I do understand, you know, you as a customer you wanna have that information in real time, but I went ahead and sent that out. I put it on my notes that you're requesting, you know, it to be sent to you. That'd be great. Yes. Awesome. And no problem. Is there anything else I can assist you with? Do you, do you feel like I've met your, you know, your requirements? Great. Um, I, I would just like you to make an ongoing note, recommendation, whatever you wanna say that this app that we need, we need it to be live. Yes. Mhm. Yes. Yes, I, and I Having this kind of system, we need it to be live. And I know I was told that I was gonna get it when I ordered it. Um, and I'm not happy that I'm not getting what I ordered because to tell you the truth, it could well and easily have turned the tide from me coming with, going with posigen and going with someone else. Yes. Because now I regret going with positive. I totally do. I could have gone with anybody else and now you're pushing me to a position where I totally regret making the decision to use you as a vendor. No. So I can't recommend you. And I will actually talk negatively about it to someone else because not having this app is a big deal. Yeah. A big deal. I want you to make whatever recommendations you've got up the chain, but it's because of this that I am unhappy and still not happy because I was told I was gonna get it. And now you guys are reneging. And if your sales person was incorrect in saying that, well, shame on him, but it's still wrong. Cause I know you have the information. I know the information is available, but Puzzygen is choosing not to make it available to me. Mhm. Shane Yeah. So that's what I would like you to do. Pass it up the chain and get the information to the powers that be that they, they are basically losing clients because of a very simple digital age request. This is not difficult, you know, it's very easy for you guys to make this available to everybody, but specifically to me. Mhm. Yeah. And I'm not getting it. No, and I completely understand that now that is something in the works. I don't know how long it will take, um, but you know we. OK Yeah. Well, until, until you do, I can't recommend you to anybody. And I will say I wouldn't have gone with you. I would have gone with another company. The other does provide it. cause other companies do provide or at least they say they provide it. Maybe they do the same thing as positives. They say they do it and then at the end, they don't. I don't know, but they say they do. Yes. All right, that's the only thing I can say that I would like you to do and hopefully things will change. No, I completely understand. And, and yes, um, there, and, and I, and I, I get, I get it, you know, I would wanna see that information to just not a month by month, you know, but as far as right now I know that it's in the works. I know I don't know how long will it take, um, to, you know, become daily or, you know, live, but I'll put that information in for you too. Right. Right. Mhm. I appreciate it thank you. OK. Sounds good. Thank you very much. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. No problem thank you have a great day.","Customer called to inquire about delayed access to their solar panel monitoring app.  The agent confirmed account information, explained the onboarding process, and ultimately provided daily production data via email.

And uh and I I told him, Miss Hall, don't check yourself out of there. Uh oh. She in the hospital right now. I know she told me. Wow. Yeah, she told me and I'm like, uh uh, don't check because she, she does sound good, she sounds strong, but they don't keep you for nothing, you know what I'm saying?

216b384c-6a2b-4f6f-9702-b84ed4c46298,"Hello? Hi, Mr. Juan. This is Gabby with Poshogen Solar in partnership with New York State Solar. Yes. Hello, Mr. Juan. How are you doing today, sir? I'm doing fine thank you. All right. Thank you so much for returning my phone call, Mr. Juan. Um, I hope this is a good time to speak. Yes, that's good. OK, Mr. Juan, I was calling because I see that you sent some bills, um, a few months back and I wanted to see if your inquiry has been addressed. Mhm. No, not yet. OK. All right. No problem, sir. We can go ahead and address those today. Um, let's see here. I do see that you submitted some bills from PSCNG. And the system was activated last year in April. Yes. OK. Um, what was your original, um, Inquiry about the bills. What is that, let's say. When your company contact me, you know, to install the solar panel. Mhm. Mhm. They tell me that it will cover like ***% of my electricity bill. Mhm. Yeah, and it hasn't been like that. Mm. Very little chance, you know, like in the winter time, I would pay like, I would say an average of $***. Yes. Mhm. And because of the solar panel bill I've been paying over $*** monthly including the bill for the solar panel. So if if something has to be wrong. Mhm. Even with the offer, you know that your company promised me. All the production of the solar panel because I still being built, you know, I've been paying like double it, but I will be paying without the solar panel. Mhm. OK. OK. All right. I do understand here, sir, and I do apologize for the miscommunication there. Um, I can clarify um a lot of it for you. Um, as I was looking through the bills that you submitted back in January. Gonna go ahead and download it here. Um OK. I am looking at the power supply charges. Mhm. Um, Here And also delivery and system charge. On the bill, so, and the total charges. So the total electric bill here that I'm seeing is $**.**. Yes. When we do a breakdown of the bill, the supply to you, it looks like you purchased um *** kilowatts from PSCNG from this bill, which is actually significantly really, really well. Mhm. Um, most customers in a ** day period, **, ** day period purchases over ****, but because the solar system is feeding into the home and the size that you have, um, you actually did not purchase a lot of electricity from PSCNG. So. Like when you compare that to what I pay the year the year before on in December. Mhm. It didn't change a lot, just about the same. OK. Very little you know. Let me take a look at the utility bill before. So I'm looking at the utility bill before, before solar, it was *** kilowatts. But it's down to ***. Um, let me get that other image up. It's down to ***. So Delivery and system of charges ** and then **. So it's, it's actually gone down a bit here. Mhm. From before solar. I'm just gonna take a next, a look at this next bill here from January. So the purchase of *** kilowatts. Yeah. Now, the added delivery fees and charges there does, you know, add that increase, but it does seem like the system is producing. Do you have access to view um the system production, Mr. Juan? Mm, no. OK, well, I can most certainly grant you access to it. I would just like to verify, is this your correct email? I have R E V J A Y B A R at yahoo.com. Yes. OK, I'm gonna go ahead and send you a link that way you can see your system production. Hm. OK. OK. Alright, give me just a second here. All right, Mr. Fine, I did send that over to you successfully. Mhm. Um, it will ask you to create a password. OK. Just let me know if you received it. Yeah. And I'm actually looking at a live production of your system as well. Surprised me because the way I was told I would not have to pay. You know, like You understand what I'm trying to say you're supposed to call. Yes, yes. You, you were told that it would cover ***% of electricity and that, you know, you wouldn't have a bill, um. OK. And, and I do apologize for that miscommunication, um, if it wasn't explained to you. So how solar works is that it works from sun up to sundown. Um, it's really impossible to completely get off of the grid, um, you know, especially the grid is always going to feed into your home, but we do have the solar system as a supplement. Bye. That electricity going into your home which pushes back the electricity from PSCNG. Mm yeah. Yeah, but you know, then the sales person should be honest. And tell the truth to the customer because. Yes. With that in writing, you know, I can do. Like, let me say, I don't like to say this thing. Yes, sir. But I can say take the system back because it's not giving me what I was promised and you know there could be a case you understand what I'm trying to say? because I was promised something that I'm not getting. Yes. Yes, and I, I do understand the concern that you have. That's why I wanted to give you a call and follow up and review your bill with you, um, and just explain how the solar system works, Mr. Juan. Mhm. OK, because that was explained to me before and the way they explained it to me is like I was saying, you know, it's not giving me the benefit of what I was promised. OK. Yeah, when I, I do take a look at the bill from before solar, um, the billing cycle, December **** to January ****, the amount of kilowatt you purchased was ***. Um, compared to now, I'm just gonna pull this bill back up again, it's gone down to ***. So, let's see. The, the thing I think, um, what should have been explained to you here, and I don't mind explaining is just the, the additional fees that are charged to it. Um, so PSCNG, um, you're charged a certain price per kilowatt and then it's broken down into different fees and categories. Mhm. Mm I can see that because I have the bill in front of me. Yes. A basic service. MFC I don't know what that is. And I believe they also add the gas in there as well. The utility rate price per kilowatt is ** cents per kilowatt. Uh, for PSCNG. And so it's, it's broken down, um. Yeah. Um ***. * ***. So that's actually a reduction of *** kilowatts. And if it was to be working the way I was promised it would be ***%, you understand what I'm saying? Yes. Yeah. And I mean, I do see that the system is producing. Um, was it just during the winter time, um, would you, was there any, any difference? Mm. Um, in the summer time I kept receiving only the first month. Mhm. I received a bill for $**. Mm. I was glad you understand this, OK, this is good, but then I got a bill for $*** the following month. Mhm. Which, which I called the company, they told me, oh, the *st * months, you know, you have to wait for the company to adjust it for the *st * months don't pay attention to just pay it, but then they kept coming, you know, normally like before, very little change. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, the change on the amount of the bill that I used to pay and then you know before the solar panel and then the bill that I get keep getting after it just not much of a change, you know, not much of a difference in the price. Yeah. Right, it is, mhm. Unless Unless the PSPG raise the price a lot, you know, in the kilowatts. Mhm. I said I'd. That does play into a factor, Mr. Juan, when they raise the price per kilowatt. I know with PSCNG, um, it's ** cents per kilowatt, but then, you know, again, they break it down. So for instance, there's one bill, you know, basic service, ** days at * cents, and then they have another fee of * cents and whatnot, but it looks like. Really, if the fees were not added in there, this bill would have only been $**.**. Yeah, yeah, that I can see. Yeah, the power supply, um, it's just the added fees in there that makes it up to the $** but the, the $** there is kind of what the electric supply, the cost is there. OK. And. I got the Email that you sent to me. Yes, sir. Were you able to log in and create your password? But Um, I don't know where to click because it says click here welcome to passaging customer. But to get started, click here. Yes, go ahead and and click there, Mr. Juan. OK, OK. OK. OK, telling me to create the password. And let me know um if you're able to log in, sir. Yeah, no. OK. Yes it did so it comes up with my address then I should press submit. Yes, sir. Go ahead and press submit. All right. OK. That's nice. OK. OK, my solar production. Yes, so it sounds like you were able to successfully walk in. Mhm. Log in there and I'm just gonna kinda go in as well. So if we take a look at this chart, um, February, the system produced at *** kilowatts. So the system has been producing fairly, fairly well. OK, let me see. OK. How do you Check into that I say I press my solar production. Yes, go ahead and click on my solar production. The thing is that OK, let me see. OK. It's it's not selling. Oh, OK. There should be a bar graph. Go ahead, um, and click on here. Yeah, OK. Yes, sir. February **** it doesn't tell me how many kill. Well, uh, if you can hover over the blue bar graph, it will tell you my solar production and it'll give you a number. Oh, OK, it's ***.*. In February, that's very low, right? Um, actually, that is very normal around this time of year, um, when we are not getting a lot of sun, um, and we have fallen back, it starts to be declining around October, November, um, and then also because of the season, the weather, the snow, cloudy days, and whatnot, that is very normal for the system to start decreasing and then picking back up again as we approach spring moving forward. Mhm. Yes, no I understand that it's, uh, it's very understandable because of the change of the fun. Yes. Now, Perfect. I just do, um, you know, I just would like to go over a couple more tips of how a customer can save. We do provide on our website if you can click on how to save more, some really helpful tips. How to save market. Yes, sir. OK, I did that. OK. So we have tips on how to save on water heating. Um, those are some really good tips there, service the electric elements to maintain the system's efficiency and life span on your water heater. Um, we do have tips as well on how to lower your electricity use. Um, I think one of my favorites there is definitely using a smart power strip for your TV, um. Hm. That's one of my personal favorites, of course, always remember to turn the lights off when you leave the room. Um, definitely investing in Energy Star appliances, even LED light bulbs makes a huge difference on an electricity bill. Right. I think they came here.

Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? My name is Edgar Hernandez. Sorry, can you verify your address? [REDACTED]. Thank you. How can I help today? Well, the lights keep flickering off and on, off and on, and it's affecting my system, all my systems, electronic systems in the house. And then the neighbors don't have any, any of those issues, so I, I got it that's because of the panels. Mhm So you guys need to have somebody here as soon as possible. Got you. Because otherwise, every, everything's gonna be damaged. For sure, yeah. I think that you, you spoke to us yesterday, uh, and reported to us, you know, this power shut down a couple of times and, and we did go ahead and put in looks like here a system check for you. So we can go ahead and take a look at it. It is live with our diagnostics team. Um, what I'll do, I'm gonna change the priority in our system over to high, uh, and get everything over to them so that they can, they can get it expedited for you. Do you have a specific day in mind you'd like us out or as soon as possible? Yes. Today Today. Got you. So I may not be today only because today is Saturday. Um, I, I don't wanna promise it to you. Uh, we do have technicians who, who work in out in Philadelphia, um, but I, I like I said, on Saturdays, generally speaking, the only, the only members of our team who work is kind of, you know, remote internal, you know, call centers, things like that. Um, so I, I can't say they will be out there for you today, but I can, I can maybe shoot for Monday for you if that's, if that's helpful. Today will be a good day. You see, the problem is I'm concerned about the electronics of the house. Because I have a lot of things that are expensive and I don't want them to be damaged because of the off and on, off and on type of problem that we're having. Mhm Got you. Yeah, no, I get you for sure and I'm glad that you called into us yesterday, um, but did it start yesterday? Was that the beginning of it? It's been, it's been going on for a while now. It just, it's really annoying because if I'm in the computer, next thing I know it goes off and it goes on. It's like, no, that this is, if the if the panels are costing, I want the panels off. Got you. Got you. OK. So, I'll tell you what I'll do instead, because we're, because like I said, we're not gonna be able to have a technician out there. Um, I can see if since because I do see the system check was, was opened up, um, in regards to wiring and it was sent over to diagnostics. I'm gonna see if potentially something that they can have reset, you know, from afar, potentially that could, that could change it. At the very least, I mean, even if it, even if it doesn't fix the problem, at least we can, we can kind of start actively working on it and we'll send the texts out there, they already know what's going on. Um, like I said, unfortunately, like I said, I wish. And it's really, it's really Go ahead. I'm really satisfied with the fact that you guys don't have anything to, to be done right away because it's really upsetting. Or, like I said, I mean. Because it could be, it, it could cost. Yeah, no, for sure. I get you. Like I said, I mean, it is something that we, we, I I think there might be a delay. I apologize. It could cost an awful lot of money. What was that? I said, I apologize for, for talking over you. I think there might be a delay. Oh But I, but I understand, I understand. But I, I'm telling you, if you. If it continuous, I, I want to get off the, those pans off the roof because it just doesn't really, it's not, they're not contributing to my life. For sure. How long ago did it start? Let me ask you that just so I can tell him what's exactly what's going on. When did it start? Yes, sir. About a week, maybe more than a week. It's been, it's been about * weeks. About a month. OK. Got you. So, uh, so like I said, unfortunately, I, I wish I could get a tech out there for you today, but unfortunately, because it is a weekend, we won't be able to do it today. But like I said, it is limited with our diagnostics team. I'm gonna go ahead and put in a notes since you did call back, uh, you know, after, after speaking to us yesterday, see if we can try to get it taken care of remotely. Worst case scenario, we can see if we can go and exit out an appointment for you this, you know, this coming Monday, hopefully bright and early to get it taken care of for you. Like OK, would that be, would you guarantee that they're gonna take care of it? Or, or it's gonna be a trial and error type of thing, but I'm gonna be facing the same issues for the week? Because, believe me, I don't, I, I work on the computer and on my, and my son works on the computer, and before you know it everything is off, it's like, oh what the hell is going on? You, do you understand what my concerns are in the, in the house and everything? Yes, sir. So that's Yeah. Sure, sure. No, absolutely. But, so I'll tell you, that's actually the, the benefit of, of things going to diagnostics first. That's typically why we send it there before we just send text out there. A lot of the time, what will happen is if we don't allow it to get to our diagnostics team, uh, and if we go straight to technicians or straight to an appointment when they get there, because they have no clue really what's happening until they arrive. Sometimes they get there, you know, they don't. So they have the right equipment. We may not have sent the tech the right technician out there. Whereas by living with diagnostics, like it was moved to yesterday, it gives them about a day or so to look into it, figure out exactly what's causing the issue from afar, you know, they kind of remotely diagnose, run a couple of tests, and then by the time they send the text out there, the techs already know exactly what's going on. They know what the issue is, they know what the target, they have the equipment. etc. So, yeah, believe me, we, we, we, you know, after your conversation with us yesterday, we've certainly taken the liberties to make sure that it's done correctly. Now it's a matter of getting it, you know, getting that service appointment expedited and like I said, we'll wait for Monday on getting that done for you. Did you have a specific time in which you'd like us out? Uh, well, early in the morning will be perfect. There's early. Got you. All right, sounds good. Like I'll be here. I'm, I'm here. I'm, I'm at home so ** to ** o'clock will be fine, but, you know, I need, I need somebody here early in the morning. Got you. OK. For sure, OK, and the number you called from ***-***-****, is that a good number to contact you on? Yes, that's my, my cell phone number. All right. Alright, sounds good. And just in case, just in case the the the. But that Oh, so just in case the, the technicians call and they may not, let's say they don't reach you, can that number receive text messages so we can, we can let you know it's us. Yes, that can, you can send me a text message, but I'm telling you, if that's not resolved, I, I, I'm, I'm out of this contract because it just, it's on you guys. Sounds good. Sounds good. All right. Alright, sounds good. So what I'll do, I'll go ahead and put the note in here, letting them know where it ran from Monday, trying to get it done bright and early, and I'm gonna go ahead and send your number over to our Arcade service team and they should be reaching out to you to mention of the the date in which you can come by and the time to confirm. OK, that'll be fine. Thank you. All right. All right. Anything else I can help? Yes, sir. Absolutely. You have a good one. No, that's all right. That's all for now. Thank you. All right. Yeah.

With using the solar. #*, when the power goes out, I still don't have power because I didn't never got a battery or anything with it. And number *, I don't think there's enough panels on the roof because I am not getting nowhere near what I was told I was going to get. OK. OK. OK, I understand. Um, I can go ahead and address your inquiries one by one for starting with the, with your bill not going down since you have gone solar. I can go ahead and take a look into your production of your solar system to see if there's any system issues that is causing you to still have a high electricity bill. I can go ahead and do that remotely. Um, just bear with me while I go ahead and take a look into your production, OK? Mm. Alrighty, it seems. OK, so I see that you were active on November *, ****. Let's see here. Mhm. OK, so I don't show any system issues. I do see that your system is active and it's producing. Um, during the cold months, you're not expected to save as much with your electricity bill just because of the colder seasons. The sun is obviously not out as much and it's a bit more cloudy during those days and possibly it might, it might have snowed on your area. Covers the the energy going into the panels, um, but other than that I don't see any issues with the solar panels. I I mentioned it's just that you were active during the colder season, so it's a little bit harder for you to see those savings because you were active during that season. Now that we're entering spring and summer, that's whenever our customers see the most savings with their electricity company. Well, it didn't snow here much last month, and my bill went from $*** the previous month to $*** and they said the only thing that was taken off was $**.**. Mhm. OK. For the solar OK. So I do see that your system size is *.** kilowatt system. Um, this is a, uh, we consider this system as a small slash medium system. Um, I did understand that you mentioned that you you think that you possibly don't have enough panels to save as much money. There is a possibility to add more panels to the home if you will be interested, um, but I do have to let you know if you do decide to add more panels to the roof, it will be an additional, an additional payment to the one that you currently have an additional lease. No, I'm not gonna do that. Because right now, I am so dissatisfied with this system that if I could get rid of it, I would. Mhm. OK. Oh wow, OK. Oh I mean, that's how dissatisfied I am. And I mean, most generally, if somebody's going solar, if the power goes out, they are, should have an emergency backup battery so that It comes on, you know, we have power when the, the power goes out, and then when the power comes back on, it should shut off. Like a generator would. But didn't get that, didn't get nothing except solar panels. OK, OK, I understand. um, for the backup battery, um, you will need to speak to our sales department. I do see that you have called, uh, previously last month in regards to the battery as well. Usually whenever you get your solar panels, they offer you a backup battery as well. Um, I'm not quite sure if they didn't have any at the time, and that's why they didn't offer it to you or offer the installation for you, um, but that will be within our sales department. Well, I'm not buying one. I mean, cause that was the idea of going solar. I thought when the power went out, that I'd still have power. Mhm. But that ain't the way it works. So this is a misrepresentation of the people that called me and told me this crap. With the battery. Mhm. Oh wow. OK. Yeah, and as I said, I am so displeased that I'm about to call the Better Business Bureau and tell them and show them my, and tell them my complaints. OK, I hear you. And I am so sorry that there was some misunderstanding in regards to the, to the solar system and also to the battery. Um, I do apologize. It's just my first time taking a look into your account, um, but have I mentioned in regards to the battery. Uh-huh. I'm not blaming you, my dear. I, I'm not blaming you. You're just, you're there, you're one of the workers. You know, trying to answer questions, but the people that, that sold it or advertised it or contacted me, somebody should be held responsible. Mhm. Mhm. Right. And I'm going to find out. I'm going to get to the bottom of it. Come hell or high water, I'm gonna get to the bottom of it and I'm gonna rave all the way through until this nest gets straightened out. OK. Because I'm, I'm about ready. I've got automatic payment plan on my checking account and I'm so displeased right now with the price I'm being charged and the service that I'm getting that I'm about ready to close the checking account and not pay it at all. OK I hear you. I mean, and I hope this is being recorded and I hope you play it to somebody higher up than you are. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Because I am very, very dissatisfied. OK, alrighty, I am so sorry once again, Ms. Condon, I do apologize about the miscommunication and missing information, um, but in regards to saving more, have I mentioned now that we're gonna start entering the spring season and the summer, um, and you would just allow about * month or * months for you to actually start seeing those savings because as I mentioned, unfortunately you were active during the winter time when our customers don't save as much with their electricity company. Oh God All right. Well, thank you, my dear, but make sure you play this, this recording to your boss or whoever it is, so that they know how PO'd I am. OK. I hear you. OK. I completely understand Ms. Conon. All right. Thank you. You're welcome, Ms. Condon. Any other questions that you may have for me? No, no, you've answered them as best your, as your ability. You know, to the best of your ability, you've, you've done very well. But somebody higher up, uh, you know, if I could get a hold of them, I'd tell them the same thing. And I might even get worse to them. But anyhow, that's neither here nor there. OK. I understood. All right. Thank you, you as well, OK. All right. Have a good day. Bye for now.

A **-year total agreement, you have *** months left. Alright, and um if I was to cancel what's the penalty? Um, we just normally ask for the, um, remainder at least to be paid out. Uh, let's see. I do notice that you reported a roof leak to us. Are you replacing the roof because of the leak or were you just wanting to repair that specific area? No, so I, it was part of the whole reason why I'm repairing the roof was you guys created a leak. I called you, you kind of did absolutely nothing about it, sent me no email, no nothing. So OK, yeah, let's see. I'm actually getting it fixed, um. Yeah, that is a pretty big. Now, what were you saying? Alright, in this specific case, oh God, yeah, that's in January, January **th you get us not us all this information. Uh-huh. Um, let me. Send out an email to the people in charge of that, um. That area Let them know that this roof case has been open since January **th and we need to motion here because if that roof leak is coming from the panels we um we conduct repairs. Uh, let's see. No, but I'm just gonna get the, it's an older roof anyway, so might as well just get it replaced. OK, um, in that case, let me reach out to management to see if we can, uh, waive the temp removal cost. Well, I Uh, so you can get the roof replaced and then we'll reinstall the panels, hopefully doing a better job than prior. OK, I appreciate it, but also what is that buyout price currently? Um, right now you have *** months left, so that would be *** times. **.* $**,***.**. And if I wanted to buy. Instead of lease, would I have that option or I wouldn't? Um, you would have a purchase option at the end of the lease for whatever value the panels retain. Uh, they call it fair market value, so the panels have a value of $**** they would ask for that $****. Um, it's really hard to tell what sort of value panels are gonna have ** years from now. Um, I know that the systems that we were installing in ****. Um, some of those leases finished up and we're now being sold for like $**** to $**** depending on the system. But those systems were also only under a ** year lease. This one's under a ** year lease, so ** years down the line. Um, I don't think the panels are gonna hold, uh, hold as much value as the ** year ones. Especially because we do expect. But you guys, you guys maintain and repair should, should there be any problems with them though, right? During the duration at least so. As part of the lease agreement. Yes, so during those ** years we maintain and repair the panels. We also carry insurance on them. So if there's ever damage to the system itself, like a storm hits and lightning strikes panel burns out the panel, we have insurance to replace the panel or say a storm sends uh or actually it hails in the area occasionally, right? OK. Yes. So, so say hail thunders down on your roof and um breaks a couple panels, we have insurance to replace those panels. Um, it would not, uh, you would not have to pay for repairs. You wouldn't have to pay for like it wouldn't increase your lease amount or anything like that. That's all covered by us. So And how do you um And how do you check to make sure that the system is working properly? We have a remote monitoring system. Because I, I OK. And you can actually monitor the the individual panels themselves. Or just the output. Depends on the system. Let me pull up your particular system to see if they set it up so I can see each one individually. Um, so they do have your layout, um, configured, which means I can see each panel individually. And each panel looks good. Uh, let's see. And, and the only reason, the only reason I'm asking is because like I've seen an uptick um compared to last year and I've actually gone greener. I'll have a more efficient. Um, unit for heating, have a more efficient. I changed out everything in the bathroom. Everything's LED, and there's still like an uptick. So I was just wondering like if everything's working properly. Uh, production wise, everything's meeting or beating expectations. Um, you did just go through winter. November, December, January, February are the worst months of the year for the panels. Uh, they produce a lot less than this time compared to March through October. Um, like, let's see. Mm, yeah, everything's looking fine production wise, um, could also be that the utility company went up a little bit in price. We noticed that in general, almost every utility company in the north right now it has temporarily gone up in price over the winter, Eversource being particularly egregious, they went up **%. Oh Uh, over in Connecticut. Uh, we do expect them to drop back down, uh, now that it's coming in March, um, they, they occasionally do those temporary price increases, uh, but we do expect them to come back down. Oh, OK. And So, what about the um the actual set up itself like um how do you guys Um, Like if, if I said I wanted more panels, is that possible or you guys have to, you are restricted by what the electric company allows you to install? There's both, uh, it's less about the utility company and more about the state regulation. So New Jersey does restrict us to I wanna say **% of your total usage. Um, let me take a look at your layout. Right, but I'm not even Yeah, I'm not even at like **% of my total usage. Yeah let me take a look at your layout to see why um. Mm. Which designs they use? Is it this * *.*? OK, so the thing that limited your system was space. Um, so you know how your, um, you have like a back window that causes the, the roof to have like a triangle that comes out of it. That creates a crease that we can't install panels near. That's why in the back of the, uh, where the front, the front of the house, there's only * panels while on the back of the house there's, um, what is that? ***, ****, ****, there's ** on the back, like all those different slopes and in uh like uh different elevations, all that restricts how many panels we can put it up because there's um distance. Regulations has to be ** number of feet from an edge, has to be ** number of feet away from um different elevations like there's a whole bunch of. Rules that we have to follow about where a panel's placed. So we were only able to install ** panels on that roof, so even though your usage supports a bigger system, your roof space itself does not. And you guys don't do solar shingles, right? Um, we have a partner that does supply us with solar shingles, but the two systems aren't compatible, and solar shingles themselves aren't as efficient as big panels. I'm not sure, but if you did the entire roof then. Do you think it would equate to it or would it be less? Uh, solar shingles have slightly looser but still similar restrictions on the sizing aspect on where they're placed on the roof, so we actually wouldn't be able to cover the whole roof. Um, we would only be able to, we might be able to have installed a little bit more coverage, but because each shingle is uh lower in power output, you probably would have ended up with about the same, maybe even less coverage. OK. Despite more of your roof being covered. Uh Alright, and just a couple more questions for you. Um, The way that it works is it that it, it sends the power directly to the company. And then I utilize the electric company's power and then it subtracts what I send versus what I'm taking or does it send it to me first and then. How does that work? Um, so the panels are hooked up to your breaker box. Your breaker box will always want to send the power into the home first. OK. And then in the situation that you produce more than what the home needs, that excess will get sold to the utility company. They'll track that number separate from the amount of power that you pull from them. And then at the end of the month on your bill they'll subtract the * numbers and charge you the difference or if you happen to sell back more than what you produce for the entire month you'll get a carry over credit into the following month. So I have a uh a follow-up question to that. So if that's the case, why is it that when the lights go out or the power goes out, we lose power? Shouldn't we still have power if the, if it's, if we're getting output or yeah, if we, if we're providing output on a sunny day. Shouldn't the house still get power? That's actually a safety feature uh that's required. Uh, the reason the system will has a, a minimal power draw from the utility line, it uses about * kilowatt per month to make sure that the utility lines are on. Because if the utility lines ever go down, the system auto shuts off, because if it were to be powered on while the grid is down, And it happens to sell power back into the grid while somebody's working on the lines, it will electrocute that person. Um, it could also cause other damage while the utility company is doing repairs. Awesome. So, uh, they shut themselves off as a safety feature. And there's no way to get like a battery or something so that in that case because it sucks to have a solar, uh, to have solar all these solar panels that I'm paying these thousands and thousands of dollars for and if I lose power, I, I, I can't use the sun that I'm paying thousands and thousands of dollars for. Um, it is possible to get a solar battery. Uh, and we actually do sell them, but I'm not sure if we have any in the area. We've been having a lot of trouble trying to get a company that will work with us to get batteries outside of Connecticut. Right now we have a special deal with Generac in Connecticut, but we can't use those Connecticut batteries outside of Connecticut because it's a partnership with Generac as well as a government sponsored program. Um, so they, they audit us and make sure where those batteries get installed. I do have a person that I can reach out to for them to put you on a list to see um. To see when we do get batteries that can be installed in New Jersey for them to reach out to you. Uh, give me one second while I send them a message. So whenever we get um information regarding batteries in New Jersey, you can be either given a phone call or a text message. Now, if, if, if I was if I was to find someone that'd be able to do the battery, would that void any agreement that I would have with you guys? Um, Good question. I can find out. Yeah, I'd like to know that I'm, I'm really pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place, especially in the summer when these storms start to kick up um around hurricane season. Yeah. Um, it's crazy cause I never expected to have to worry about hurricane season in Jersey. But um we tend to lose power quite often and this winter we lost it for about * to * hours and one of the coldest days of the winter. So, Uh yeah, give me one second, let me type up an email to him. I know. I know. OK, I sent him a message. He is gone for a day. He left about an hour ago, uh, but he's pretty good at responding, so I imagine, yeah, I imagine I'll have a response for you tomorrow, uh, not tomorrow, Monday morning. Sent him a message. No worries, I understand. OK, and you said that you're gonna follow up with with somebody as well about um covering the cost of the, the temporary removal. Correct. Um, they are also gone unfortunately, but I'll have a, um, I'll hopefully have an answer for both the battery and the temp removal, uh, by Monday morning. OK. The I definitely appreciate you. What's your name? My name is Jack. Thank you very much, Jack. I appreciate all your help and your patience and and answering all my questions. Absolutely. Yes sir, uh, we're here to assist and um I'm sorry if you haven't gotten the assistance you were looking for. Hopefully I was able to make up for it at least a little bit.

I don't know, we should have an app showing us exactly what the solar panels are doing, what everything is doing. Yeah, it's, it's positive.com that you need to where you need to register. I can. Yeah, uh, but, but Jonathan is, uh, he, he's not giving me anything and he keeps saying, **, I, I, let me talk to somebody because they're saying it's not ready, it's not ready. I don't understand why because you just said it's been activated since January or something and now it's March something. Yeah, I normally take between *. Yeah, I know, I know they say they're not, they're not gonna bill me for like ** days, but I, I mean, we're just about there, yeah. I can't even see if the, like, like what the solar panels are doing. Mhm. If you go to position.com, you can register, yeah, and, and create your account and you can see production and pay, paying your bills too. Well, I've gone to that thing and it and it said, it said it's like some uh some shitty set up like and it shows me no information. The only thing it like like lets me do is like go to the bill pay page. I can pro Because maybe, maybe it wasn't producing yet. Uh, let me see who is the vendor here so I can send a message to him. And tell him that he's not replying to you, wait, he's not replying to you. Let me see one second. Mhm. OK. Yeah, no problem. Let me see who is this. OK. It's Jonathan Solis, correct? That's correct. OK. Let me see if I have his. Let me, let I mean he's not, he's not answering my he's not answering my text messages, he's not answering my phone calls. Mhm OK. OK, I understand that. What, what So now, so now I have like a bigger issue with that, you know. Uh-huh. Oh, I understand you're frustrated. Well, uh, uh, what I can do now, sir, uh, I will send in a personal directory email to him and it will be stressing the urgency that you have to him to give you a call that, that you really need. Yeah, but he's known about this and he has, he's known about this issue and he hasn't done anything about it. Yeah, yeah. So, probably, yeah, yeah, I don't know exactly what's the situation with him if he got sick. Can you, can you send it to somebody like, like bigger than him that can take care of it? Yeah, but it's, it's a chain because we don't know if, if this person is sick right now, is out of work for some specific reason, so I will send to him the email. OK, well, it, well, is, is there, is there another reason why I'm not able to like have an app that I can go on to like see uh you know, what's happening with my solar? I mean, you tell me what, what should I be able to see if when I go on my solar app? Oh, I should be able to see like what all the all the panels are doing, right? How much they're drawing in right every day. Mhm. Mhm. Correct. I should I should see the savings plus plus the uh the outgoings correct? Yes, correct, sir. OK, well, I, I don't have any of that. Like I, I have, I have *. And it's been active and there's gonna be a bill coming up soon that I'm supposed to pay you guys, which I'm saying absolutely no because you guys are doing nothing for me. So I don't even know what my solar panels are doing. Why am I gonna pay you guys a bill? Mhm. Let me check it out one thing. Absolutely not. So what I want you to do is cancel my first bill, put that off a whole another ** days until we get this app gone. Mhm. Mhm. Absolutely. Cause, cause I can't get answers. I can't get help and nobody's hooking me up. Mhm. Well, yeah. So you're gonna help me push my bill off a whole another ** days until you get my app gone. Hm Because I'm not gonna pay you guys for not not helping me. OK, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a ticket with the IT department to see why you don't have access. What I was trying to do before is trying to send you the link that I have, but did you try to go into position.com? I, I have a possegen.com link that does, it brings me to this like this bogus thing and like it says like uh it's some like temporary freaking app and all it does is bring me to a a bill pay and it says nothing about usage, it says nothing about anything. It's, it, it, it's something my child could have built. Like it, it looks it looks absolutely horrible. OK. It's it's the one you guys sent me originally. But I, but I am positive you guys will not get one dime for me, ** days until I get this app going because you guys aren't doing anything for me. So you guys are gonna cancel all bills until we resolve this. Cause I don't understand why this, this, this should be like a, a normal thing, correct? Uh let me see. Um, I'm trying to figure out why. Uh, on my side what I can do I can create a ticket with the IT department so they can. Basically go and see if they there is some kind of issue with your account technical issue or or if it's not ready yet because it's a new account so what I can do is contact them and have a. Yeah It's not it's it's, it's not new, it's not, but it's not a new account you just told me it's been open since like January something and and I'm about to get my first bill pay, but yeah, I can't see a god damn thing what's happening on the roof. Oh Mhm. Mhm. That's what I don't understand. If it's, if it's not generating the amount of energy that you guys like guaranteed and like you know it's not, that, that's fine. Then, then, then push it off. Don't bill me until it is and then but make sure I get this, uh, the, you know, I, I need this uh account so I can like open it up and like see what's happening. Mhm. Yeah Because you got guarantee that ** uh ** whatever uh kill us. You know, with, with the system that you put on, but I understand it started in February, so probably, you know, with the with the clouds and blah blah blah it it might not have hit it, so you guys wouldn't be accountable for, uh, you know, because you didn't guarantee you didn't get what you guaranteed. Mhm. If that's the issue, I get that. No, actually, actually, what, what is guaranteed in the ** months your account is recently opened for, for the savings and everything it takes like ** months. Well, Mr. Roy, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send a ticket to the IT department so they can assist you. I mean that they can create because this needs a technical assistance. If you have some box on you cannot register your account and unfortunately on my side I cannot do anything. I need to contact the IT department. That's what I'm gonna do and I will contact the gentleman that he's supposed to be attending you your phone calls and send a message that that you that you want him uh contact you as a. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I have issues, yes. OK. OK, sir. I will proceed with those, uh, with those uh two emails. I'm going to take action. OK, so how many days should I wait, uh, how many days should I wait for a response until I uh respond back? Um, let's say today's Friday. Let's give them some time to the IT department. Yeah, I'll I'll wait I'll wait till Tuesday. I would say um. How about I wait till Tuesday? I don't know if it's maybe a few days more. I would say by Thursday because I need, if there is something that, mhm. OK, can you, can you tell me, can you tell me when my first bill is getting, uh, billed to me? No, there is no bills generated you, yeah. You don't have any bills. OK. You don't have to pay anything now. Alright. Not, not on, on, even on the next cycle. Uh, well, I I realize that I mean what I'm asking you is do you think that's the reason why because it's just not jittering enough like do you think they're waiting on this? No, no, it's a normal, it's a no. I'm asking, I'm, I'm asking you like reasonably. Yeah, it's a normal processor. No, yeah, exactly. I'm, I'm not saying because like because of the solar fields. I'm just saying because of the time of year. I'm sorry. Could that be like a reason why this is happening? No. Uh No, not at all. It, it's, it's something, I don't know, it has to be technical to access to the website, it has to be something technical that it has, it can be resolved by the IT department. Uh, because, yeah, I saw your system is completely activated here. Uh, I checked everything, so I don't see any any other reason. OK. Mhm. And, and they're, they're connect they're connected up to E. They're connected up to Eversource and everything. OK Yes. Yes. Yes, OK. I, what did you ask before, sir? If it's connected to where? OK. No, they're connected with Eversource, uh, my, my electric company. Yes, yes, it, it won't be activated if it's, if it's, if it's not. I mean, all the steps are, are not followed.

Oh, OK, sir. I'm gonna, I'm working. What's, what's the, what's the what's the, what's the issue with this? That I can't see what's happening with the energy. This is what nobody's like give me the answer to. Yeah. Mhm. Yes, I will have to contact the IT department to see why. You don't have access to the website, sir. Well, the, I mean, it's, it's been a long time since I've been like connected with Eversource and like the energy we've been provided back and forth, so.

e406dcc9-be64-44d3-8bc6-cf0a4edd87b9,"Thank you for calling Posh and, this is Jack speaking. How can I help you today? Yes, um, I was on the line with another young lady, and I was telling her I've been having solar panels with positgen for years, and they've never worked, and I just recently learned that they should be doing a lot more than what they're doing. Basically they're just sitting on my roof. My electric bill never went down. I don't think it's feeding power to the grid, nothing. They they put them on and they've never been back to check them. We were never able to get online to monitor them, nothing. What's the address? It is [REDACTED]. Louisiana *****. OK. Under Kelalade? Yes. Alright Let's take a look at what's going on with that system. One second. Hm. The panels could be performing better, but you're still getting a good bit of juice out of them. Let me take a look at the cases that are on file, see what they've done. They haven't been out anytime recently. There's a production case back in ****. Let's see electrical. Let me compare what they're supposed to be producing. Uh, I don't know what they're producing, but my bill never dropped and my bill still runs between $*** and $*** monthly. OK. Really? Let me take a look at your. Yes. OK, let me take a look at everything. One second. Yearly consumption limit of **,***. Um, did you move into that home back in ****? I moved in in ****. ****? OK. ***, so why is the bill missing? Data Alright, and the reason I asked that is because the um the bill that they used to assess you. Only has one month's, uh, one month's worth of usage on it, so they had to estimate your yearly usage. They estimated you to use uh **,*** kilowatts per **, **,*** kilowatts per year. Mm. Um, I'm not sure why that is. I moved in that house in September of ****. Yeah, the only reason I could see that happening is that Entergy moved here, uh, changed their meter for some reason in September of ****. Oh That's probably when I got the, that's probably when I got the panels installed. This was before the installation. This is what's used to assess you, uh, to see how much you used to see how much, uh, we can install like because um we're only allowed to install a percentage based on your usage, otherwise entity won't approve it. Uh, Entity never messed with my meter, uh, other, otherwise when, um, only time entity messed with my meter is when you guys finish doing the install. Other than that, they were never out as far as I, I know to do anything with my meter. Yeah, that's. Alright, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up a case with the field service team. As a diagnosis to take a look at that system, see that why that system is not fully meeting ***% expectations. And then you said your bills right now are averaging **,***, like *** still? Yes. Yes, they never went down. I can get my the history of my electric bill from the time you put those panels in and they never went down. And if I add the amount I I've been paying for my electric bill on top of that $** I've been paying y'all every month, my bill is, you might as well say $***. That's probably Let's see. Let me take a look at how much you've been getting from us versus what you would have paid. So you want **. Divided by **. And I, I, I, I feel like positives just threw those panels on there and just abandon us after that because we've never been able to do the monitoring online. I've never seen a change in the bill. Nobody's ever come out to check them to make sure they're working adequately. Nothing. I had you guys put my roof on, you removed them, charge me to remove them, put the charge me to put the roof on, charge me to put it back on, and they still aren't working. Hm. So I can't say. Here, how about we do this? Um, let me go ahead and open up that field service, um, diagnostics with field services to make sure that what's being reported to us is accurate. OK And then additionally, uh, would you mind sending me a couple of your bills so we can do an analysis of your bills themselves? Sure. Alright, give me one second, I'm opening up that, uh, field service request first, and then I'll uh send you a bill request email. OK. OK, I'm going ahead and opened up that ticket with field services. Let me backtrack and send you that um. Bill across the email so we can do an analysis of the account. And your email address is um Q E N C A L A D E at gmail.com? Yeah, A D as in delta. Yes. At the end, yes. Alright, so I just sent you a request for Bill's email. The email itself is a template that asks for * bills. If you would like to send more than that and also older bills, I'll take a look at however many bills you, um, send in. Um, I'm the savings analysis specialist here, so it's actually pretty convenient you got me on the phone, um, whenever you send bills, if you're trying to send more than what the mail system allows you. Um, you can send multiple emails, just make sure to reply to the original email I sent you so it uploads automatically to the account. OK Alright And let me just go ahead and notate real quick. Alright, I went ahead and notate that. So, um, whenever you send the bills in, uh, just give me like a week or two to be able to, um, process everything and then I'll give you a call. Uh, I'll be the one to give you a call with what I find, um, the math behind the analysis. Um, if everything looks good, I'll be able to go through in detail why we conclude that everything looks good. If there's any issues, I'll be able to go into detail on what those issues are and what steps we're gonna take to resolve them. Um, for example, if we see that your, um, savings, you've been. Um, only saving like $** a month for the past, uh, * years, then I'm gonna be able to go, uh, go in and say, alright, your savings are below expectations. What we're gonna do is apply a permanent discount the remainder of the lease, uh, to get you into a better standing for savings each month, um, if it turns out that the panels aren't saving you anything. Uh, we're gonna see how much your, what's the difference between what you should have saved and you actually saved is and then compensate for that difference as well as figure out how we can get you into a saving position. Um, if it turns out that those panels need to come off because there's just absolutely no solution, then I'll see what sort of compensation we can give for the payments you've made in the meantime as well as make arrangements for the removal. Um, if it turns out that the system is doing perfectly great and you just need a second system, I'll give you the math to support that conclusion and also offer to reach out to the team in charge of upgrades, uh, to see about getting more solar coverage. Um, but I'll be able to get you a detailed information on the analysis when I call back. OK, perfect. I'm probably gonna get, I, I work for a solar company now as well so I'm also probably gonna get uh them to do uh the same analysis just to see in comparison. Alright perfect um if you need any production data, uh we can provide you production data, no problem. Actually speaking of production data, you mentioned that you've never gotten access to your um solar monitoring. Let me check if I can get you access to that right now. I exactly. They keep giving us the password username and reset passwords and it never works. OK, here we go. Right Do you have * solar systems with us? No, I had *. I got rid of one. OK, um, is the one that you're, um, looking at the **** Lakeland? Yes, you said Lakeland, OK. Yes. OK, here we go. So let's see, monitoring for Lake Lynn. That's set up I should be able to. Go into. Here Create modify. Alright, I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do a reset password. Um, you said the resetting of the password hasn't been working for you, right? Correct. Let me try and log into your account to see what's going on. OK, submit. Hm. I'm able to get in just fine. Why doesn't the password reset work for you? Mhm. OK. OK, um, Your Yeah, let me just um. Can I grab your average yearly, here you go. I'm gonna send you a follow-up email. On the analysis case. Mhm. Of your production. For ****, ****, and ****. Mhm. I might as well go to the beginning ****. **. ****. ****. ** Alright, so I just sent you production from **** from **** to ****. OK. Alright, um, anything else I can do for you? Mm No, so you're gonna submitted the ticket for. The field team to do the analytics. I'm gonna send you the electric bills and you sent me the production from **** to ****. Yes. And I'll get a detailed analysis of uh how your system's been performing versus the bills, see what's going on. Uh, the main thing about the bills is to see what your price per kilowatt is because the amount that you're paying uh *** years ago is probably a lot lower than you were paying now. So the bills just help figure out what your price per kilowatt is to figure out the dollar value of the production. No Hello this. OK. All right. Um. Alrighty I forward to you for.

Listen, ma'am, just listen. But I mailed in for the whole * months, uh, introductory offer. I sent a payment for * months and and they hit me up on the credit card. So that's * months, you understand what I'm saying? Sorry. If they put it on my credit card for the ****, I mailed in * months, that's * months. You understand? Hello? Yes, sir. I completely comprehend and understand everything that you are actually saying, OK? What I'm trying to get you to understand is the process in which we work, OK? We, you made a payment on. OK, OK. February *st of $** right? That's the only payment we had taken out. No, ma'am, no ma'am, I didn't, I didn't make a payment. They put it on my credit card. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I made a payment for *, yes. That, sir, sir. I understand. I made a payment for * months. I wrote a check. The check went through. It cleared. Y'all cashed the check. That was for the whole * month period, OK? And they put, put it on my credit card for another $** so that's * months. You understand? I didn't make a $** payment. Sir, I They put it on my credit card. I have a question. When did you mail in that check? What date was that that you mailed in that check? Yes I'm ma'am, ma'am, I just gave you the date that the check clearance from y'all's bank. Y'all cash the check. Not what I, I mailed it on */**. OK. So, once again, sir, that was after we had already took out that one payment, you get what I'm saying? So with that being said, if you subtract the payment for February, we took out on the first before you even mailed in that payment, right? That means the check. I have no idea what. Sorry, if you, if you, if you, if I, I, I, I hear you. I, I hear you. I hear you, but I don't understand, you know, I, I didn't realize that I was on, uh, a credit card. I, I, uh, that they had automatic bank draft on my credit card. I didn't understand that. I wouldn't have mailed in the the * month thing, so what I'm trying to get you to understand, yes ma'am. Sir, Can you please take a deep breath? Yes ma'am. Just take I'm not upset. I'm fine. I'm not saying that you're upset, sir, but I can honestly tell that you are frustrated and you're, I understand that it's overwhelming. I'm not frustrated. I just, I just, I just don't want them to be double billing me. That's, that's what I'm trying to avoid. I'm trying to avoid a situation where I've already paid for the the entire * month period with a check. The check cleared. It's not, it has not been put onto my account. I have not been credited for it, but the check cleared on your end. OK. Do you understand that? Yes, sir. I like, I've been saying this whole time. I understand what you're saying, but if you can allow me, OK. OK. And And they put OK, I'm listening. If you can allow me to please walk you through our process and how we process. Payments that are mailed, OK? OK. I can, I can explain it to you so that way you'll be able to understand how the process works. I understand that you were unaware after we had already took out this auto payment on the *st that you were unaware that you were on auto pay and you mailed in a payment for * months in advance, right? What I'm trying to explain. Yeah, and they cleared on on. It cleared on the **st of February. That was the date that it cleared. It was, it was, it was. So in order, in order for it to clear, it would have had to go and post on your bank statements, right? And Its posted on my bank statement on the on February **st. OK, on that bank statement, it has a reference number. Not at all. Do you have the app? What bank do you bank with, sir? Not at all. I bank with Liberty Bank. OK, so * times out of **. That's a bank in New Orleans. That's a banking. Yes, we're, I'm here in New Orleans as well. So, uh, if you go to, if you go on the app and you see the list of transactions, you see that particular transaction, all you have to do is click on it. Yes, sir, on the app, it has the identification number. That's what I've been asking for. Yeah, and all I can. OK, all I, all I can tell you, mm. Oh, I'm supposed to go look on the app. OK, well I'm not on the app. I'm on my checking account statement. That's what I was trying to tell you. So if you're looking at like a paper statement, it's possibly not there yet on the paper statement. That's what I'm saying if you go on the app and you click on that particular transaction. You talk about on the pos you talk about on the positive positive in that? No, I'm talking about on your banking app. My banking app is for last month. I've already cleared the check already went through. It was for $*** *** cents. It has the You know, Sir, I'm gonna have your, your case manager um follow up on this because I've, at this point, I don't know if it's a miscommunication or what, um, because I've, I've tried to express the process. This, uh, the, the what I'm trying to explain to you, what I'm trying to explain to you is that I pay for the whole * month period, OK, with a check, OK? I'm on, uh, y'all have me set up on automatic bank draft, I mean automatic credit card, uh, automatic credit card, correct? Yes, sir. Mhm. A Mm. It's going on my credit card every month for **** and it, OK, so what I'm trying to tell you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I, I'm gonna take you up for autopay. Just listen. I don't wanna just listen. I, I, I, I just want you to listen. OK, they got me on credit card pay, automatic credit card pay. Mhm. I did not realize that, so I mailed a check in for the whole * month period for $***.**. The check cleared. It's not showing up on my account and now they're gonna probably go and hit me up for a *nd $**.**. They already got one that they've done on my credit card. They're getting ready to do another one since I'm on automatic, but I paid the full * month promotional. Mhm. Mhm. Amount with a check that went through and cleared. You understand? Sir, I understand. I'm, I'm I I processed it. I, I understand. Yes. I acknowledge what you're saying. There's no, uh, thing, yeah, there's no things on my checking account that have a transaction number. They just have the, the, the check number who it was paid to. On my, on my bank statement that I get every every month. Now maybe once my bank statements. And you're looking on your physical bank statement, right? No, this is, this is, this is my my running toe. I have not got my bank statement yet. OK, so I have a question. Do you, on your app of your bank, they give you day to day transactions. OK, I have not received my bank statements for February. I'm on, I'm on the app, yes. Right. Do you see where the $*** came out at? Yes, that's what I'm on. That's what that that is what I am on that's. It came out on. Oh, it, it, it's. Cleared on the **st of last month. OK, under that it should be. OK, but they don't have any kind of they. They don't have, it's nothing this is what it says, uh. It says February **st, **** check number $******.** and then I have my, my balance, my running balance that was left in my account. That's all I have on, on, on this transaction that I have. I have not gotten my statement. OK, so what, so our process is when we, when customers mail in our their checks, right? Yeah. We run it as a one-time transaction, right? So with that being said, it would be basically instead of you being on autopay, it would have all of your routing and your um your account number, and it would be a one-time payment. So you should have a confirmation number on your bank side because we're gonna provide that to them because we're not drafting it and processing it. We're currently doing that as a regular. OK. OK, well that I, I was just concerned that it's not showing up. The, the check, the check cleared and it's not showing up on my account. That's what I'm concerned about. Card payment So, like I said, you know, previously, it's gonna roll over. OK, is is that the check, the check clear on your end. Oh, OK, OK. Are, are they gonna have a uh so I will have a credit. That's what I'm trying to find out. I will have a credit on my account. Yes, sir. That's what I was stating to you. I OK, that's what I was trying to find out, OK. OK, all right, thank you, ma'am. OK, sir. Do you have any other concerns that I can assist you with? No, I, I, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna go and try to get my account and I'll call back once I get there so I can give you the number, right? Thank you. OK, so I do wanna do a clear summary of the call real quick, sir. You did, um, call in regarding making um a payment in February for $*** that was the. $***.**. $***.**. ** cents that was for the entire * months, * month promotional uh period. Yes. Yes, sir. It was for a * month period. Um, like I said, I do understand that you called in regarding already mailing in a payment in February for * for $*** and, oh Lord, Jesus. I'm sorry, for $***.** and that we did discuss the process of OK. Right, for ****, right. ***,***. Mm Yes ma'am. Mailing in your payment, how we process those payments and how the payment will roll over once it clears on our end, um. But it's clear on y'all then. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Yes ma'am, but it's cleared on y'all then. That's what I'm telling y'all got my money, but y'all still charging me on my credit card. That's what I'm trying to get. You have a supervisor? I need to talk to your supervisor, please, if you don't mind. How we do, um, spread it out within future dates. Please.

Um, my zip code is *****. I don't know if you can see the account yet, but. Um, I was involved in a fraudulent, uh, issue that wiped out my account, and, um, I've since been mailed another, uh, debit card. Mhm. OK. Um, but apparently I spoke to someone and you already have my, uh, what do you call it, my checking account information, um, but let me know where we stand with payments and so on and so forth, and I have a, a couple of complaints that I wanna address, but we, you know, I'm told to, to mention that to you as to how. OK. Do I get rid of this system? It's apparently not panning out for me. It's not paying off because. Mhm. I don't know. Alright, so let's, let's handle first things first, um. Right. So it looks like you have a scheduled payment. Yes, sir. Do you, do you have my. Go ahead. I have, I have an account on file. It's a JP Mortgage Chase account. That's the one we have on file. Uh Yes ma'am, that's uh do you have the checking account information or or debit card? It's a checking account information. Uh, because they apparently. OK, I, I may have called that in before. I don't, I don't, there's been so much going on. Can I, can you believe? I don't even know who I'm talking to anymore. I'm let me stop. Alright, so I've called several of my creditors and I've, I may have given, uh, a few of you guys the, the, the checking account information to prevent this from happening henceforth that, um, that that card gets debited and run into a problem, etc. etc. So long story short, so you do have my, my actual Uh, checking account information, so that means I called you guys and, OK, alright, so what's gonna happen, uh, billing wise, uh, when, when, when, when am I being billed for and, uh, what date and then can you tell me what the amount is because I thought I got that result with the with the late fee or something to that effect, um, that they were gonna charge me $** some odd dollars uh you should be uh uh uh. Yes, sir. Yes, ****. Alright, so do you see that they, they brought it back down to the **, whatever it is because. ****. I kind of, uh, uh, yes, that I, I called because sort of told the young lady that was waiting, helping me that I've never been delinquent, um, in, in all my right, and she sort of granted me after getting permission from one of your supervisors I guess that, uh, that should be waived. Do you see that? Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, I put that was me. That was me you spoke with, um. Yes, I, I did put in to have, I did put in to have your um your $** waive. I did put it on our wave sheet. Um, it takes a couple of days for it to go into effect once they approve it. So yes, it has been put on the um. Oh, OK. Right. OK, so The adjustment sheet. In the OK. OK, I'm sorry that I didn't remember your name, um, but in any event, um, Shannon. OK, Shannon, um, so. That's OK. I'm Shannon. Is there, uh, and, and I'm being recorded so I wouldn't ask you to to really answer this, but I need to get out of this contract and is there any way that I can do so because it's not panning out for me. Um, Right. Can I say that it's not, uh, I'm still getting a $** some dollar bill uh from you guys every month, which I'm like I said, this is the first time I've had an issue with not paying because of the fraudulent issue with my account, however. Right. Um You know, I, I just, they, they're offering everything from, from the moon to get solar panel and because I've already had it and have it through you guys for years now, um, I'm not, I don't, I guess I don't qualify. So am I able to get out are you guys able to come and get your equipment and cancel my, I don't know what I'm asking just that I, I just need I'm desperately, I'm, I'm disabled. I'm not able to. Mhm. Mhm. Oh my God. So Is there anyone that has successfully successfully canceled their account with you guys? I don't know. Do I need a lawyer? No, let me, let me uh just tell me. Uh no. No, nobody, um. So what'll happen is if you want them removed, they charge a removal fee and you're still responsible for the outstanding balance in your account. Um, so even if they come take them off, you still have to either pay it outright or you continue to make the payments. And then if you don't make the payments, then I don't know what happens after that, but um I know that they, you're still responsible for the outstanding balance on your account. And that was like **, ****, ****. Are you able to tell me what that amount is? And that No, it's Yeah, let me tell you with the fees and taxes. Hold on one second, let me multiply this. Give me one second, I'll figure it out for you. And even don't even try it if it's an extra extravagant amount because chances are I cannot afford it, whatever that is, unless I win the lotto or something or you got some magic numbers for me. Well, you see you gotta have, you gotta have faith, you gotta have faith. Um, so with taxes and fees. That's, that's right. With taxes and fees, you're looking about $**,***.** to get out of your contract. This. Knock out the removal fee. ***, uh, no, no, OK, let's, let's, let's, uh, let's forget that. Alright, Justin, are you ready? Alright, I'm just talking to myself. Alright, so listen, everything is uh in online, uh, for you guys to take out, uh, how much money? $** some odd dollars you said? Yes, sir. That's OK. Mhm. **** and uh it's gonna show **** on your end if you go online or whatever, but I did put it on the adjustment sheet yesterday. Well, when the day I talked to you, when was it? * days ago? Uh, ** or. Mhm. Right. Right, I believe, yeah. Yeah, so I'll put it on the adjustment sheet that day and um I'll put it on there again just in case they, um, I don't know, sometimes they miss them, but I'll go ahead and put it on again that way I'll make sure it was on there twice. S Yeah. I. And uh that way I know for sure it was, it will come off, but we have to submit it first for it to be processed. OK. Mhm. OK. And uh being you a good customer and you haven't really been late, you shouldn't have nothing to worry about. Alright, you've been a sweetheart. I, I appreciate you and um, OK, so uh when is that due to come out? can you tell me that and and I'll let you go thereafter. Sure. Yes, it's due on March **th. So on the **th, it'll automatically draft from your account. I And that that's the month, March **th. Thank you much, man, OK? Yes. Thank you. Now, let me tell you this though. If for some reason the **** comes out, what'll happen is once that $** late fee clears and they write it, you know, however they do it, they take it off, it'll be a credit on your account. But I did put in, like I told you, I did put in for it to be removed. I appreciate you. Uh-huh. Mhm. Yeah Right. Right. I see, so I should have picked like a **. Yeah, I'm hoping by the **th they have it removed. You're the greatest and I do appreciate you. No problem. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Mario? OK, I, I do appreciate you and I. No, remember that God, uh, received the glory and um I thank you much for your, your assistance. Thank you, sir, for that. You have a great rest of your day.
