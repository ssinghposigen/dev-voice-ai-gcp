And by Celia. *****. Thank you. Mhm. And what's the customer's name? It's Javier Andrati. I think the seller's Patsy Freeman or something like that. Mhm. OK, so it looks like it is in process, uh, they should be reaching out uh in within the next, I would say next few days or so. Yeah. Um, I called them last week, multiple times. Um, and they did tell me it takes a week or two to be processed. And then they told me that it should be approved by today. Is there any way we can find out if that's still on track? Well, the new customer. Was emailed On the *th Mhm. I'm not sure if they received that information. But all of the information has gone to the department to finalize everything, but we, we do have to wait for them to do that. OK, so does it say if I got approved? I can tell him it was sent on the *th. But it's not a loan. I mean, they're, they're just transferring. Which is the The lease to that, that particular owner. Yeah. Um, They just said it was like an approval. Right, so Like that we're waiting on the approval. Do you know if it's noted on there by chance? Mhm. No, it's not that information. It goes to the next level. The the information gets sent to the customer, they would have to sign the lease, send it back to us, then it gets finalized, signed by by us. OK. And it's completed, but we, we do have to get that customer's signature so if she signed it already? Yeah, he already signed it. He already signed it like * weeks ago.

Is there any way I could have him call? Would that help? Because we need to close on time and um. No. Because there's nobody to transfer to. If it gets trans They Yeah, that would help too, if that could be done. There there's nobody there's nobody to transfer to so the information that I have is the the most latest information we're just waiting for that department to sign it and it's completed so. OK. The information was sent over to the. OK, um, cause escrow. OK, let me, let me have him check his email for the *th. Mhm. Um, Um, Because escrow needs a document. Otherwise, we can't close. Right. Um, But again, they, the, the finalization department has everything, so. So I'm telling him that I'm on the phone with you. Yeah. You should be fine. What's the email that would send it to him that way he can look it up because he works, he has like a city engineer job and he has a business. Mhm. Um, that way you can at least look it up. Do you have it? You can look for anything from positive. Because there's there's few representatives who may have sent it. I'm not sure who did. I just, I'm reading notes, so I'm not sure exactly who sent it. OK, let me see, it should be. OK, let me see. He said, I got the signed docs. Can I can forward to you? OK. Alright, so if he signed it and sent it back. Let's see, and then if, if we need anything else. He's good. Yeah, he said I got the sign docs. It sounds like he got his copies. Mhm. Well, then that means he's done. Um, If it's signed by Posogen, everything has signatures, that's all he needs. I can *. I wonder if, if, if it, uh, it's the UCC one because I've done a lot of different uh solar transfers and every provider is different, um, but what I do know everything's the same is there's a document that has to be provided to escrow, otherwise we cannot close. But when I tried multiple times to call, they said, oh, you know, we do have escrow's information, but it's gonna be sent to the buyer or even the seller, and I said, OK. That's fine, but we need that document to be sent to escrow cause they need it. And what is that document? I don't know the name of it, but they usually, that's what I'm saying, I've never had to get to this point. Let me see if it might be this, he just sent me something. I usually just provide escrow's info and then you guys send whatever they request in order to close. I don't know what it's called. Uh, let's see some. OK. Uh, there's a passage and signed it. Gabby Castellon. Mhm. So that means he's, it's transferred it's done. So it's signed by her. OK. So, Is this what I give escrow? Let me, let me send it to escrow. Let me see. Let me see what they say because I wanna say it's more than this. It's usually a specific document. I've seen a UCC one. Um, And some other ones, and they've been visas too. Let me ask Maria.

Is now a good time to go over some account information concerning your solar system? How long will this take? Hm. How long will this take Oh, about * minutes, not even that. Yeah, that's fine. Got you. I also need to let you know this call is being recorded for quality assurance and training purposes, and I just wanted to extend a warm welcome to our solar family to tell you a bit about Posogen. We served over **,*** customers just like you since ****, and Postagegen has assumed all rights, obligations, and responsibilities of your current lease agreement. So just to confirm, I have the name here listed as Matthew Sorman and the address is listed as [REDACTED]. Is that accurate? Yes Awesome, and I have the phone number ending in **** and the email is listed as South CHASWV@gmail.com. Is that accurate? Yes, that is. Awesome, and would you prefer to be contacted by email, phone, or text, Matthew? All three's fine. Got you, thank you so much for confirming that information. Now just to point out a few details regarding your account. I see here you have a ** year lease agreement with a monthly payment of $***.** each month. And that rate will increase by *.*% each year. And I do also see here that you elected to have everything drafted on the *th of each month and you will be receiving your first bill in the mail in about ** days and on that bill, the account information that you could use to go on to passage.com to access your billing information if you ever need to. Do you have any questions regarding that information? That it's funny you called me because I just contacted Solar Hauler yesterday or yesterday last week about because I hadn't heard anything and I didn't want to get behind on the lease payment because I don't like to be, uh, I wanna do auto pay if that's even a thing for you with you all. Mhm Mhm. You, you're already set up for autopay. I don't, I don't wanna forget. OK, good. Mhm. Yes, already set up to be drafted on the *th of each month, and your drafting won't start until about ** days after this call when you receive your first bill. Um, so for example, you're gonna receive. OK, is there like a portal online? Yeah, um, so on that first bill, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That we can view this just. Mhm. Go ahead. Um, on that first bill there's gonna be account information. That's fine. Um, there's gonna be account information on there that you can use to go on supposit.com to access your billing information and all all payment information in general. Sorry OK, cool. That was my next question. Mhm. Yes. Awesome. Because we might we're changing we're changing our credit cards around us we'll put it on our new one. Well, if you want I can give you a fast um solution so that I can send you our ACH email right now and you can add in your updated billing information now if you want. Would you like for me to do that? OK. Yeah, that'd be fine. Yeah. Awesome. I'm gonna send that to the email you just confirmed. We're keeping the other card, but we're just switching it to another one that gives us more points. Got you. Um, uh, we have a new and a reward system and this one gives us extra points for it, so. OK Awesome, that's completely fine. So I just sent it it should be an email now, um, and again you're gonna receive that first bill in the mail around the end of next month, and then you'll be drafted, well, as of now you're set up to be drafted on the *th of each month. So if you keep it on the *th, um, you'll get that first bill around the end of next month and be drafted either on the *th of June or the latest the *th of July. OK. Mhm. Are there any other questions I can address? Awesome. The last question I had, yeah, I got one more question. Uh, my wife and I went with the lease because we didn't know if we were wanting to purchase it and so we decided to do the lease to see if everything would work out so far it is, uh, when is they told us we get a buyout option at a certain time? Do you, do you know? Yes, sir. Mhm. Mhm. Uh, when, when that is. So let me just pull up the lease agreement. It has an exact area um that could tell you that answer and I can even send you a copy of that lease agreement so you could see for yourself. Would you like for me to do that? Yeah, that's fine. Awesome, um, so the page you wanna pay attention to. Because at the moment we're gonna buy it out whenever that we get that. Mhm. Alrighty, so here on page number *, under option number * it says purchase and you may purchase the system at a price to be determined by reference to um a readily available independent source that will be I'm sorry, identified that will identify and disclose to you at least *** days prior to the end of the initial term so. *** days before the ** years is up is when you have the option to purchase the system. They told us like a year * or year * is what I understood. I just didn't know which one I remember which one it was. Well, let me see if there's anywhere else in the lease agreement that states anything about the system being purchased. One second. Would you mind holding for * *nd, Matthew? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. OK. You are on hold. The answer to this. She's busy. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. Hello Matthew. Yes. Yes, um, I apologize for the wait, um, and thank you for holding. Um, so after reviewing your lease agreement, um, it does still say that *** days before the system is, um, the lease is done, but I wanna do a little bit more research before I give you a concrete answer on that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know that's not right. That's not right because what that when that that was the whole only reason we didn't lease because he told us we get a buyout option that year I think he said year * year * from the gentleman uh from Solar hauler and. Yeah. Yeah, um, and I, that's why I say it doesn't seem so outside of the scope of possibility, so that's why I wanna do a little bit more research before I give you a con a concrete answer on that. Um, so I'm gonna give you a call back with that full answer. Is that OK with you? I just didn't remember which one. OK. OK, yeah, that's fine. Awesome, awesome is there anything else I can address at this time? No, that's all. Thank you for your help. Thanks for calling today. Of course it's not a problem um I just have a few more things before we conclude um I do want you to keep an eye out for your email. I'm gonna be sending you a link to your passage and customer portal that's gonna give you access to monitor your system performance. It'll ask you to create a password, and when you do, it'll take about ** to ** days for that monitoring access to be loaded onto your profile. So create the password and then check back in about ** days and everything should be up and running for you. OK. OK. And lastly, um, are you satisfied with the level of service you've received thus far? Yeah. So, so happy to hear you had a positive experience. We gotta get that whole lease thing ironed out, but that's the only thing that's a little irritating at the moment. It's hopefully you fix that. Yeah, um, I do wanna, like I said, I just wanna do a little bit more research before that is given. Out with a full chest of air. So, um, I'm gonna give that to you when I get a chance, OK? Um, yeah, other than that, everything was a positive experience. Right. Yeah, absolutely. Awesome, I'm so happy to hear you had a positive experience and it has been a pleasure speaking with you today.

I'm doing all right. How about you? I'm good. What can I do for you today? So I am a, I am a current customer, but I cannot get into my account like using the app or even if I go online. OK. Um, and I think it's because y'all have the wrong email address for me. Let me see. OK, that's what I was gonna say let me see what we have on file and and make sure that we actually sent the link to the right place. OK, so first of all, Yeah, cause when I tried to go in and say. Mhm. And I, I was, I was trying to go in and say that, you know, oh I forgot my password and then you know, to send me the thing and it wouldn't, I would never get it. So then I said, well, let me put in, I forgot my login information. So I put, I forgot my login information and I put my email in there and it says my email doesn't exist in the system. So. OK, alright, let's let's figure this out here. So first let me get to the account so that I can get to that um place where I can send and and verify where we sent that access to. So Hillary, what's the address? It is ***. Coal landing, which is shortened to LDG. OK. Laplace, Louisiana. Got it. Alright, so the email that I show here is H as in Hillary, P as in Preston, Z like Zulu, Preston, R like Romeo **@gmail.com. Is that right? That is, that's correct. Alright, perfect. Now that we've confirmed that, let me get to the next point and see if we have sent this link to you. And I do not see that we have sent this link so that's why the user name does not exist because we never sent the access to it so let me do that. Hold on just a second. Oh Oh, no, no. All right. And aside from this, how's everything going for you, Hillary? Um, so far, OK. All right, great. I haven't um had any issues, I don't think. Fantastic fantastic so I sent an email to you it will give you a link where you can reset your password to create a new one that will take you to our customer portal where you can see the system production on a monthly basis and then it'll also give you another area where you can log in and create so you'll create a new access. OK. Um, even though you're creating a new password right now, you'll have to create new access for the billing portal if you wanna access there, and then there's also another portion that will allow you to get into referrals if you want to submit referrals and get paid out for those as well. OK, let me see. Cause I think I did this all already cause um when, you know, when the guy came and we find everything and everything um. Mhm. But hey, I'll do it. I'll do it again. Let me see what I put in there. I think. And it could have reset to be honest, it could have reset from the time that you know he set it up and and we placed, you know, our account system in the in the service, yeah. What did I put in there? I think it did, because. I think it did because let me tell you like where it like it tells you um this is the step we're at. It stopped at the permit part and it just never kept, it never went anywhere from here. Uh, So it probably was a glitch then. So that's why I know I've done all this before. Uh-huh. Yeah, sounds bad, sounds bad well let me know if you got that email please. OK, I did, I did get the email and I'm trying to see if it lets me in. It's saying um To reset the password. So let me go ahead and change password and see if it lets me in. OK, good. Uh, let's see here Submit **, yeah, that's right, submit. OK. My account, pay my bill. I think I'm in there. Now, what is it I'm doing? I can do what on here? You can see the production of the system. I see where I can pay my bill. Yes, yes, that's. How do you do that? Well, let's see here. What options do you see on your. My solar production. There it is. Do you see any anything that says click there? OK. Oh, I see it now. It says my solar production, yeah, it's a little bit further down, and I can do month, year, and life. OK. OK. Alright, so that's production. I can see where you can go and pay the bill. Alright, great. Alright, yeah, I have my bills set up on the on it like it just comes out automatic. No I don't think I need to just bill pay thing. Alright, and will the password be the same for the app if I have the app? Yes, it should definitely. If you set it up that way, that's the password you normally use, we don't have access to reset it. OK. Like it, like on your without your, you know, receiving a link kind of like I just did today. OK. All right, well, let me see if it lets me in now because uh. Let's see, project stages. Did it update that? No. It's still at the stage where it says permit submission. Project stages, is that, is that where, is that what you're wanting like an update on the project? Yeah Oh well, no, cause I've had it for a while, but that's what I'm saying like it, it stopped at that at that stage where it says uh something about the permit and it never went any further than that. OK. Mhm. Yeah, I'm not sure why that is, to be honest. So like when I first got it, I was getting something. Yeah. Yeah, I was getting updates and it was like, OK, contract approved, and then, you know, welcome to Posy again and then like it it was moving along and then it just stopped at * at stage *. It never went any further. Right. That's so odd. I wonder why that is because I can get into the project details and and it tells me everything went through. Yeah. I have no idea. And it even gives me like, like dates of when it was completed so I, I, I wonder that's a little odd. I'll talk to the IT guys and see if maybe that that was a glitch or something. I'm gonna log out and then I'm gonna log back in. And let me see. I log back in. So it's my email. That's my password. Let me see if it updates. Yeah. Mm. Nope, it's stuck like that. It's still like that in there. And then also when I go into the my wallet thing. Mhm. Um, My info is not in there either, and I, and I have it set up to like automatically come out of something that it's not showing in there. Alright, let me reach out to the IT team and and see if we can get some help with that, OK? For the my wallet it's showing your information like no contact details it just has payment information tied to it, right? OK. Uh, it doesn't even have that. There's nothing in there. Like I never set it up. Can you edit anything? Does it allow you to? Um, let's see. No. I'm mm. No. Nothing that allows you to edit? No, let's see, that's the adds. OK. OK. OK.

It's letting me in, select the location where you wanna view. All right. Thank you for being patient. That's all right. OK, so now I'm back in. Great. Um, If I want to see. Like how much I paid for like the year of **** cause I, I was, I was what got me started on this because I'm doing my, oh, you'd have to give it to me. OK, cause I'm I was doing my taxes and I was like, well, maybe I can just I'd have to give that to you. Yeah, I can, I can give you those statements, yeah. OK, alright, yeah, I thought I could find it on here. I was like I could probably pull it up on here and then just, you know, put it on my taxes, but I'm glad I called. Yeah, maybe, maybe some of those statements, yeah, some of those statements might be there and, and maybe they're not all complete. So just to make sure that we're not missing any information, it's always best that you just call and I'll email it to you. So let me just pull up what I have here. OK. All right, well that's great. And then if you ever have questions about your billing or anything at all, you can always call us and and we'll help you know it doesn't matter what it is. So let's see here statements give me a moment. Oh it's not pulling up anything. Hold on, I think maybe this is not the right information. Give me a second. Mhm. I don't know why I brought up a Hillary Reid. Was that a previous name you had? So, Preston is actually my previous name. Reed is my married name. OK, OK. But my, my house, when I bought my house, it was under my maiden name, so they had to put Preston on, so we sent it, uh-huh. There it is. I found it. OK, so they updated to the to the read and so the read didn't pull any statements, but the Preston does so here they are. OK, I found it. OK. So I have October through March. So I'll download those. Mhm. So I got * of them total for you. And then I'll send that to the email. Give me just a second here. And in the subject I'll put your statements. OK. Congratulations on getting married. I don't think I've been married for years, but um when I bought my house, my house, you know, I bought my house before I got married. So, um, It's always nice. Mhm. OK. Yeah, so that's why my, my house, like the. Paperwork for my house is still under my maiden name. Mhm. And I just never changed it. OK, no worries. So when they got ready to do the solar stuff, they said it had to be under Preston because the house is under Preston. So I was like, OK, well, fine. I won't fight you for it. Right. Right, right. Alright, let me attach these all. All right, and there they go. Did you get the email yet? Let me see. I did. Great. OK. Did you have any other questions for me? Mhm. Uh, no, wait, this is, oh wait, the first one is just an invoice. Wait, let me go back. Oh Well, these are just invoices. Did I send you, let me see, let me see, let me open them up. Oh yeah Yeah, these are just Oh, so it's just see which doesn't even show that it was paid. Oh my goodness. See, when I click on it says this is the statement, statement number. Mm. Yeah, it's on it, yeah, these are just the invoices that um that I've been getting. OK. Let me see what I can get here. So you want proof of payments? Yeah, yeah, for, um, just how much I paid so I could put it on the tax, um. I can, mm. Tax document. OK. The best I can do for you would be this let me send this to you and see if this will work. OK, I'm gonna drop that real quick. Just a second here I'm almost done. OK. No brushing it all because I am definitely multitasking. There it goes. So it's not allowing me like a a formal document like these invoices that I have for you, but I do have all the proof of payments process under your account so that's what I've sent to you. Mhm. Mhm. And it'll have the date and it'll show status process and if there's anything refunded how much was processed and exactly what time it was processed. OK. All right. So then it also has the confirmation numbers there if you need that I can potentially print let me see if it'll let me print anything out. I could potentially print this out it's, it's like a long receipt. Uh, you have to print it or you can uh Let me see, it'll let me download it. Let me go back. But can you just PDF it? Just send me a PDF? Mhm let me see, let me see if this works. I'm gonna send you this one that I just downloaded and tell me if this works for you too. OK. Alright, there it goes. And if that's good then I'll I'll download the rest of them. I didn't realize that I was able to access that so bear with me. OK. Alright, so that's the first one. Second one. Mm. This one's not letting me do it. There. There it goes. All right, let's see what's in here. OK. The first thing you sent me. So the first one is more like just a screenshot of all the payments process like a whole summary of them and then now what I'm sending you is the individual ones, OK? Mhm. Oh, OK. So, So I've only had this since The *th month? Uh, no, there's more, but that's just, that's just the screen. That was the summary. So I have total ones that I'm downloading now are from July up until April *st. So that's the ones I'm going to send you individually. ****? Mhm. So let me finish those. Alright, I'm almost done. I just got like * more. Just one second. Mhm. Goodness. OK, there they go it looks like a total of. No children. *. Let's see. That the same as far as getting. OK. So I thought I had this for a whole year now, but apparently not. Apparently it just started in, in, in what's the *th month? July? Yeah, that's that's the first one I see available in all the statements here. Now, we, we do allow you ** days after the system's placed in the service before we bill you. So you, you receive basically the first month and a half for free. Oh, OK. OK. Let me see when your system exactly went into service here. OK, well, maybe that's what it is. Our recorded activation date shows to be March **th of ****. But I don't see any billing for March of ****. Let me see. Mm. No, let me see if you were on a promotion, maybe that's what it was. Maybe. Mhm. Yeah. I do remember some something. Yeah. Looks like it was a promotion. Because I, I, I even see you got the * for, for *. Hm. Yeah, I don't see anything like it, it's not showing that you're. Behind or anything and I don't see any payment process you know or any invoices processed prior to that date. OK. Yeah. All right. I guess we're good. Well, Mrs. Reed, is there anything else I can do for you? Mhm. No, that's it. All right well I appreciate your call I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks, you too.

I'm just trying to. OK. Wonderful. Harder, yeah. I understand. You know, get some information and figure it out. Yeah. Um, uh, yeah, and I, of course I had people here this morning at * a.m. so we'll see what they, what they saw, but my biggest question is, um, and I might run out and get another quote before I actually make a decision, but, um. Uh. Mhm. He was saying we'll go with the **% and it might produce more. So you're never really um getting rid of your uh your bill at that point for sure. **% will cost your monthly payments less. So that's the other thing, but not if you're buying electricity as well. You know, so I don't know if that's the best choice or if it isn't or something in between, but I don't think you do have anything in between it's one size or another. So I was kind of concerned about that. Mhm. OK. Um, so I don't know, um, exactly, you know, what was it when, when, when he went out there, but honestly, um, you're never going to be ***% away from the utility. Utility, solar panels have to be connected to the utility. Yeah, I know that. To the grid, and so the utility company is always going to charge you an amount uh for using one, their meter, their, their equipment, right? So you're never gonna not have the uh a bill from them, uh, but it is solar is the only way you will not depend on them ***%. So, as far as sizing goes, I'm not sure what um Mhm. Mhm Right, right. You know, usually the salesperson will look at your bill, and they'll size you based on that bill, um, you know, yes, if you overuse, then you have to put some more, but mhm. Mhm. And then if Yeah, if, um, right, um. I guess after a year of monitoring it, if it's decided more would be better than they put more then I guess. Yes, you can. Mhm. Which Mhm. So rather than run ahead and put some that you're, you know, collecting more than what you'd normally need, although I do have mini splits and could easily spend more. I just don't use them in the winter at all. I just mostly use them for, well, in the fall and in the late spring, it's OK. But um and then for air conditioning when I need it. Yeah. Mhm. Mhm. So I, I don't over abuse it where some people, although it's cheaper to run them for AC than it is for heat. They're not that cheap for heat. But you could go through and use solar if you had it. Mhm. But it, it would take a little too. It, it, it does use some energy to heat in the winter with them. Or whenever I do use it for heat, it does. It's not like, well, it's practically free. Well, um, not here. Right. Right, right. No, I understand. So yeah, I mean, it's just best to see how you do within a year and then after that, if you feel like we need more then at that point you can add more. It's not a problem. Yeah, no Mhm. Uh, so, um, that's where we at. So what I would, what I'm going to do is email you my information that way you have it, um, and if you have any further questions, you can call me or if you have any concerns, you can call me, we can, you know, you'll have my direct line. Mhm. Yeah. OK. OK, all right. All right, ma'am. Thank you. I'll be, so your name will be on the email, right? Yes, ma'am. My name and my direct number. Ali. Cause I didn't quite catch your name. OK.

56161c7e-17ae-4f7b-8762-ba6b190f9f17,"Hello, this is Corey Posen. How can I help you today? Yes, so my name is Mark Adam. I'm calling on behalf of one of your existing customers right now. Uh, account, I'm, I'm an engineer and so I'm, I'm looking at she's selling the house and we're looking at, uh, information about the existing solar output. OK. I, I give you the account number. Account number is ***. Yeah. ***. ******. Alright. Is this for [REDACTED]? Irene I would assume I don't have the address in front of me. I can check on that, but uh, Irene is the is the woman's first name. I can dig second name out. OK. Irene, OK, yeah, that, no, that, that matches up. I just wanna make sure I have the right thing pulled up. Me too. So the main question is I was looking for, did you, where is kilowatt hour output generated by the solar found? Do you have that? Is that, is that a remote access you have on that? Yeah, so, uh, let me check. I think it's in her lease agreement. Double check here. Uh, yeah, yeah, so it's on page * of her lease agreement. The, the Uh, what, what is on page *, the, the guarant well, does it get the guaranteed that what you mean? Yeah. So the, but the question I have is what is the output right now uh the system with the, uh, real, the house is being sold. That's why this is coming up right now and the real estate agent wants to look. OK. Yeah I got you. OK, so you. Went to look and could not find an output that showed the kilowatt hours generated by the solars to date. Got you. So, uh, the, the. So is that is that something that you monitor? Yes, the customer also has access to that as well, so she could view it, uh, and provide that. OK, uh, where, where is that found at, at, at the house? It's uh it's through an online portal it's called the customer portal, so she could log in and and see all that information. Oh, so it's, it's, it's a remote access. Yes sir. OK, can you tell me then? I don't know, I, I, I don't have the login credentials. Is that in the con I have the contract actually with me is, is, is the login credentials in the uh contract? No, so that would be, uh, the, the, the customer would have those, those credentials. So, um, I am slightly limited to the amount of information I can give to somebody not related to the account, um, I guess my next kind of question would be like kind of like who are, who are you in regards to the to the customer that we're, you know, under contract with. I didn't see it offhand. Well, I guess So, so I'm, I'm an engineer, she consulted. An engineering consultant, OK. So Got you. I, I, I, yeah, but I actually worked in the utility industry all my, my entire career, so. Got you. Yeah, so I wouldn't, I can't provide her credentials because I can't see them, uh, so she, she sets up her password and all that on her end. Well, can you tell me how much, how, how can you tell me the kilowatt hours per year then? is that information you can give? Yeah. That should be fine. Let me pull up our system here. So do do do. All right. Last year the system produced *.** megawatt hours. That's up there. And uh just out of curiosity, it's, it appears that she pays, I, I know she pays you at $**.** dollars ** cents a month for the lease on that. The, the, do you also get to, do you get part of the Yep. So is, is, is she then on on on uh net billing net net metering where, whereby she just puts the power out in the meter back backwards. Mm Yes. Well, I don't know if she's on net metering or on like a buyback. It depends on her specific local utility and, and what their solar plans are, um, but she's on whatever, she should be on whatever solar plans available there. OK. That's it's Pico. So it's Philadelphia Electric Company. Do you, do you know offhand what they their fan would be? Uh, I can, I can check. I think I have a Pico bill here. Let me see what they do. Pico, uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure Pico's Netmeter it looks like, but you have to double check to see because it is, it kind of depends like when she signed up and what program she's under and stuff. I'm pretty sure Pico does Net me now. Uh, one follow up I know I, I noticed going through her contract that she had a guaranteed rate of return on the first year. Yep. And did she make that guarantee or did was that ever validated and then Yeah, so that's only uh typically done upon request, so she not sure let me see if we have anything. For her Mm. Yeah, it looks like we did do one for. Uh, almost a year ago now. Uh, let me see. That'd be about right because it was installed in **. Yeah. I, to be precise, was April **th, ****. Mm. Looking through the notes here. Yeah, it looks like, I mean it looks like everything these tickets closed. I see where one of our agents spoke to the homeowner and went over the analysis, so. I don't see where she posted the actual results for it, but since there's no credit or anything attached, I would assume that uh they did determine that she saved some form of money. So as I read this and so it's it's. Um yeah it looks like that was done about a year ago. Actually it's, it's this is pretty close to what you see what did you project? Uh. Looks like it's pretty close to what you projected offhand. Yeah, so actually it looks like it actually produced more than projected. Looks like it's like year * or *, it's more in like the * megawatt range, whereas last year produced produced * megawatts, so it looks like it produced produced more than we guaranteed. Don't have that So I, you guaranteed around *, well, you, about ****, actually **** kilowatt hours, which is, uh, * megawatt hours. So this is, it's pretty so the *.** would be just about. No. Let me take that out. Make sure I'm on the right one here. So like mine had a little different number than you were mentioning there. I'm, I'm going to get, I have the contractor and to get it real quick. Yeah, the one I'm looking at is, is, uh, **** kilowatt hours. It's only guaranteed in year two. That that's the guarantee, but you also did a predict you also did a prediction and so I think you're close to the prediction. No. Oh, we don't want the prediction, got you, got you, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, it's somewhere else in here. I got you. Yeah, the prediction is a little different, um, yeah, we'll we'll, we really go off of the, uh, is the guarantee, uh, that's part of the lease agreement we make, we guarantee it'll produce, uh, at minimum, uh, at that level. That's that's what you, that's what you, that's what you care about for sure, yes. So it's really it's it's minimal, uh, I guess her, her net income because she's paying you $** a month and she's getting like maybe $** a month. She's on on on her savings on electric bill. Actually, I like your front page. Your front page is a nice summary. Got you, thanks. Uh, you know, Irene Webster. And there's this [REDACTED]. I got that here, Lafayette Hill. I know I found it when I read through it in more detail. Sure. Here we go. There's your guarantee there's, there's your guarantee **** KKW **** kilowatt hours. Yep But then you have the projection. But anyway, it, it, it met the uh it it met the the uh. The minimum, so well, she, she's over what you guaranteed. Correct. That's the bottom line. Alright, I guess that answers the question for now. Uh, but while I have you then if she so as I as I read this contract, she has or or the new buyer of the house would have uh three options. Option one is to would be to assume this this lease right now, correct? Yeah Uh, yeah, really it's mostly it's really, yeah, I guess three options, uh, assume the lease, pay for the removal, and cancel the contract, or if she's moving to an area that we install, we could move the system, but typically we try to avoid that option when possible. Yeah, I, I, I, that, that doesn't make sense, um. Yeah. But yeah, typically we do with one of the first two either either assume the remainder of the lease or pay the removal fee and kind of just end the contract. So yes, so I understand. So obviously if if the new buyer decides uh decides to, uh, assume the lease they would have to put a put a a new contract with you and really the main reason for getting this number is to show that there is, it doesn't make sense to pull it out because it. It's it's earning money compared right now to the lease amount $** a month. Correct, yeah, yeah, which is, you know, we, we don't really, uh, sell or install if we're not, uh, certain that it's gonna, you know, be a positive return or else it's just unhappy customers and, you know, things go go downhill from there, right? So, um, uh, but yeah, yeah, if you sell the home, the number one option is just to sign the lease assumption. All it is is they would have the exact same contract they would just assume the remaining term. Yes. I I And about how if if the new buyer chooses to remove it, about what's the cost? Yeah, let me check if they have it listed. It should be listed in here somewhere, or they may not have it in these newer ones actually, let me see. Uh, OK, it looks like you don't have it listed. Let me see if I can grab that price there real quick. Uh, Pennsylvania. By the way, how, how many KWs does you have installed there? Do you know, uh, what, what is the, uh, or uh. Yeah, I can. It's a *.* kW system. *.* KW OK. Uh, so the removal price. I'm the guide here one sec. Uh, it would be ****. ****. OK, that's that's that's fairly reasonable actually. Sure. All right, well, that's great. Uh, you've been through all my questions. Awesome. Glad I could help. And uh I do appreciate it right thanks now right. Perfect, yeah, you have a good one. Bye bye.

Yeah, I understand, um, but like I was saying, you know, we usually ask that you give it about ** to ** days from the activation date. Yours was February **th. It still hasn't been the ** days, so on the next bill that you receive, you should be able to see a difference on your energy bill, and then your lease agreement does guarantee um savings, so it just needs to some time to generate enough energy to be able to affect your energy bill.

Um, I got panels added on to like my first one level, and I wanted to know which account is it set up on auto pay and what is it on a card, a Visa card? Mhm. OK, let me verify. What's the name and address, please? My name is Maya Martindale. The address is [REDACTED]. All right. Thank you for that confirmation. This call is being recorded. All right, so let me see, it shows in my system that you have * systems. All right, so you're trying to find out. Yeah. Um, system one or which system in particular? So that's the, so I got a call where they're saying that one of them was set up on autopay. I don't know which system that is. I'm trying to figure out what that one is. And then I got a statement saying that, and then I got a statement that it was $* that was gonna be deducted or I owe $* because it's not on autopay. So um I just I need clarification on all of that, on that those answers. OK. All right. All right. Let me verify then. So I got this account ending in ***. That account is current. This one is not, not on auto pay. OK, let me check the other one. It might take me a couple of minutes, OK? Cause I need to do one by one. Mhm, yeah, that's fine. Maybe you can start with the one that was just added because I think that probably would be the issue. Alright, let me see. So this one account number ending in ***, this one is not on autopay. Either Is that the one that, that was, that was the one that was just added or no? So I'm not able to tell which one was recently added. Let me see. Do you have the account number by any chance of that account? I don't, um, if you tell me the prices then I could tell you which one was just, which one was, I think it's the, cause it's like one that's **** and then there's like a ****, right? Yeah, so the one that I'm Or **** and **. The one that I'm looking right now, um, the payment, it's for **.**. So the last payment made was for March to pay two months, um. Yeah, so the other account. Let's see. So it's **** and the other one is **** or is it ****? The other one is **.**. OK, and that one shouldn't be on auto pay. So what's the next one? What's how much is that one? OK, let me check the other one. Give me a second. OK. Uh OK, so it looks like you only have * systems. Are you paying * accounts or just *? That's what I'm trying to figure out, man. Uh, I got * sisters. And I paid for *, but my opinion has the other one, so I'm trying to figure out is that one coming out separately on his account or what? Like that's what I'm trying to figure out with you. OK, let me see. Yes OK, because this thing is only showing me that you have two accounts, but one it says floor *, floor *, and I saw floor *, but it's not giving me the account number for **. How much is, how much is the *rd *? How much is the payment? It's not even, yeah, it's not even showing on my system. So give me a second. OK OK. Let me place you on a brief call, um. Huh? I can't hear you, ma'am. Let me place you on a brief hold. OK. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. OK. Thank you for the wait. I on the *rd account. I'm sorry about that. Alright, so the other account it looks at that it's for ****. Yeah, and this is the most recent one. OK, is that one set up for? Is that one set up on auto pay? Um, let me see. No it's not. It's not set so so it's not set up on auto pay. No, it's not. Because when they set up they told me that it was a card that was charged to that one so that's what I'm kind of confused with. Alright, so it's ****. Alright, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Um, let me see. This one has a balance of $*. Uh, I believe it's the non-ACH fees. So that one does have a, so that, so that's the one that, so that's the one, so it's $* this month and the next month is gonna be $**.** dollars. If you guys enroll on autopay, yeah, but the account has a, I think it has a late fee as well too. Let me check. This is your your tenants um account? No, so what I'm Yes, no, ma'am, just listen to me for a second. I got a bill saying it was $* but what I'm trying to figure out is because they, he just got it installed and they told me it's gonna take a month before it happens. So my question is, if it's $* the next month, the bill of ** $** is supposed to be due? It should be **.**, to be honest, but has the account has some fees here. So what I'm able to do is I can um. Waive the the non-ACH fees, but the account needs to be on roll on autopay because it's not, I mean, I can waive it, but you're still gonna have it for next month. I don't have none of them on ACH though, so I don't even understand why I have a balance. That's what I'm trying to say to you. My other two are not on ACH either. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, you don't have it. But the thing is like, for example, for the one that has the balance open for $* for the non-ACH, I can waive that non-ACH fee. But for next month, you're still gonna have that um extra $*. So my question is to you, OK, so I, I would appreciate if you could waive it. My question to you is, is it gonna be if I don't enroll in it, is it gonna be $** like $*** plus $*? Mhm. Yes, that is correct. It will be **.** cents because the regular price for that account is **.**. And adding up the $* yeah, it will be **.** cents. Yeah. OK OK, so my question to you, so. Was this just the $*. Yes. Guess what? It's only the $* the fee. OK, so that's why I need to come I finish. OK, thank you. You want to waive it or how, or you, were you guys? No, I, I would like for you to read it. I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it regardless. I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it regardless, you know, as a courtesy here, but I just advise to um. Thank you. Enroll it, so you have that uh you don't have that extra $* there. Thank you. OK. No, you're welcome. Just give me a couple of days because it needs to be adjusted, um, but yeah, I'm gonna submit the request to waive the fees for this month and next month. Mhm. OK, thank you. You're welcome. That Um, do you want to write down the, the account numbers? Alright. For future reference so you know in that way you have all the information. Um, Can you, will you be able to email it to me or no? No, no. Cause I don't have nothing to write it down right now. No, I won't be able to. OK, so yeah, I have to wait another time to do that. All right, it's it's fine, no problem. All right thank you.

Jack, how you doing? My name is Mel Mercer. Um, I just received an email from Posen, and um, and it's a copy of the lease that we signed, um, well that I signed, and I don't, there's some extra documents on here that were not a part of the original document that I signed.

It wasn't Yeah, this is the first time I remember saying this was not a part of the original Pos um DocuSign that was sent and we signed. Gotcha. Yeah, Solari Philly is the Because I have the original document that day. Mhm. The solarized filly is a I'm sorry, go ahead. Sorry to interrupt. uh, SolarX Philly is the program that's uh used to help fund the solar programs in the Philadelphia area. Um, that's why that's in there. OK. Um, all that is is um.

That's a good question. I'm not sure why Solarice Philly doesn't assessment different from ours. Mm. I'm gonna have to ask the operations team in the area to see why that there's a difference between what solarized filly assesses versus what we assess and install. Cover sheet for release my. October November. Yeah that's a good question. I'll have to reach out to um operations for an answer. Um, do you mind if I give you a call back? Um, hopefully within the next ** minutes to * hour. No, not at all. Sure. Yeah, I'll go ahead and find out for you and I'll give you a call back as quick as I can. Um, regarding that difference. Do you know what numbers gonna pop back up or no? Um, No, unfortunately not. I can send you I can call you twice, uh, that way you know that's uh it's me giving you a call. Alright, no, it's no problem I'll. Um, that won't work either. My phone has a blocker on it. Can you email me first and then I can unblock it and I can, and then I, you know what, don't worry about it. I'm gonna just take the blocker off, that's all. I'll take the blocker off until, until I, until I talk to you. OK. Actually, um Do you mind holding on? I might be able to get an answer for you right now.

So it looks like solarized filling uh doesn't have anything to do with the actual like writing of the contracts they just have sort of a template that they fill in. Um, their main thing is getting the government funding and also, um, like local placement, uh, both jobs and student training, it looks like. Um, so the reason why theirs is ** years is because their template is for ** years versus our actual, which is ** years. Uh, we previously did ** years, um, but towards the end of. Actually I wanna say towards the middle of **** we started doing ** year leases. Uh, so I guess So I really just never updated their templates. It could be also that, um, a couple of the other installers that Solarice Philly works with, there's like * or * different installers. Could be a couple of the others use ** year leases. OK. So it's a it's a template difference um your actual lease is the posing portion since we're the ones that installed and we'll be uh maintaining, monitoring and sharing the system. OK. Alright, thank you so much that I want to make sure. Yes sir, uh, sorry for the confusion there, uh, but thank you for your patience. Mhm All right thank you have a great day. You too take care.

Mhm. Oh Alright, so it does look like they have someone scheduled to come out today. I don't see that it's been canceled. The job is still open. They haven't started anything yet, but we do have you scheduled for today. OK, it's supposed to be for today. Do you know about what time? I have, have put, I've put everything on hold waiting for these people and it's just like normal. It's just not worth two dead flies and a bowl of sour milk. I've had these things. It's Oh. I do apologize, ma'am. I've had these things for * years, and that's * years are the worst years of my life, you hear. Mhm. They are not worth the powder to blow themselves to hell with, and I'm sorry, I'm, I'm doing it to you just like everybody else, but everybody that knows me knows that they're gonna hear it because they're not worth the money that I'm having to pay for them. Yes, ma'am. Mhm. OK, so can I ask you, is your system behind a locked gate? No. OK. So if you do have to leave, you you certainly can. They don't need to get into your home. Everything they have to do is on the outside. I know. I want to be here. I want to be here. But if you want to be there. OK. Well. I do because, like I said, everybody has ever come before, um, the same thing. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Mhm. Mhm. Um Oh OK. I do apologize that you've experienced that, but they are scheduled to come today. You know, but you know, if you could. I don't know if you. I don't know if you guys are still understaffed or what. Are you all still understaffed? Not that I'm aware of, no, ma'am. Not, Are you new? No, I'm not. What No, you're not. Is, is Beth Elizabeth there? Is her, well, I think her name was Elizabeth, or could you see who uh I had talked to the last time I was there. I, I spoke to somebody and she was really, really nice. No. Mhm. And I mean, not, I'm not saying you're not now, please. Excuse me for saying it like that, you know, but, uh, she really, she tried to help me too, you know. So, but, you know, my biggest problem is that I've got to pay you guys $** a month to get a $* kickback. Mhm. Mhm. Something's wrong there. Well, What you're getting on your light bill, the credit on your bill is basically anything that you did not consume, so you're saving when you use your panels during the day, everything that your panels create, you run your home off of that so you're not buying from the utility company during the day, so you won't see that on your light bill. You only see anything that you didn't consume on the light bill. Well, they're telling me ever since I've been here that these things are not working properly, ever since I've had them up, honey. They've never been, they've never been pro. Mhm. Well, we do have someone. We have someone coming. They're scheduled to come today. And they will take a look and see what they can find out. OK. OK. OK, and I do see that Elizabeth did put a credit on your bill for * months, so. OK. Because, let me, let me Right, right, right. You know, and, and that's what I'm saying. I mean, that, now it looks like from what, uh, I don't know what date probably in just some time this month, probably I'm gonna start getting a $** bill, uh, and a bill from you guys again, correct? Well, let's see what you have. Yeah. That was back in December. So you got January, February and March, so April you would start to receive a bill again but once we find out what's going on, if it's for any reason that they can't fix it today, we can certainly apply another credit. Thank you. So it's not just because that credit is over, you don't, you don't, you start to build. If it's still not fixed, we can do another credit. OK. Because OK. Because like I said, you know, I, I, I've lost my job, and believe me, money is very funny right now. And $** doesn't sound like a whole hell of a lot, but I can't get a job anymore because of my age. Mhm. Mhm. You know, and, uh, if, if they can't ever fix these, can they take these things down? Yes ma'am. Well Can I cancel? That that's a, a long way off and I understand what you're saying, but I can't make that call, but we do have to fix it. It is in our, our lease the maintaining it, we have to fix it. So they will definitely fix it. Uh Mhm Oh Uh-huh. You have to fix it. Yes ma'am, that is part of our agreement with you. OK. Well, I sure appreciate it. At least the * months. I was glad for that. But you know, like I said, I still had the year and something else that they didn't fix it, you know, and these people, they would come out and they'd say, well, I don't see anything wrong. There's nothing wrong and all this, and Right. Mhm. Uh, uh, Doreen was the one I used to always deal with, and she said, oh, Miss Janet, she said, I am so, so sorry, you know. And, but she, she knew, she knew the problem that I had, you know, but I never got a credit for those for that either, you know? And like I said, hey, $** doesn't sound like a whole hell of a lot, but it is when you don't have the money, you know. Yeah. Mhm. Right. Right. So, but, um, you know, like I said, I'm, I'm so sorry to be ragging you out and this is the first time I've talked to you, you know. That's fine. You're OK. I understand, but. So Mm, please accept my apology, you know, but like I said, you know, when you're paying for something and you know, it's not working. Right. You know, you're, you're not a very happy king of all. I understand. You know, But there should be someone coming out there today to take a look and see what we can find out and how to proceed from there. So. OK. OK. OK. About what time would be the latest that these people would come out here? I spring. Well, let's see. Would you be able to give me like a time frame? Well, I do know they're coming from uh the New Orleans area. So it's gonna be a, a nice ride. What I know that too. I know exactly where you guys are. I know what Saint James Drive, um, I know where James Drive is in Saint Charles Parish. Yes, I do know, I know it very well. Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. I used to live, I used to live in Mantaray. Mhm. OK. So it's about a two-hour drive, uh. Yes. I would say at least give them to at least. Yeah * OK Because we do time windows, not necessarily one specific time. Mhm. Yes, yes, yes, I understand, but they, they had said, they, you know, about *:**, and I was thinking *:** would be about the latest, you know. Mhm. So when they say *:** that's that kind of starts your time window. So. Hello? That starts your time window *:**. Mhm Oh, that starts, that starts my time window. I thought, you know, maybe from the time from the, from the morning to *:**, so from *:** to about *:**. Yes, ma'am. Mhm. I would say give it to at least *:**, yeah. OK. And then if they don't call, and they don't come, do I call you guys? OK. You can certainly call us. Back or I don't see anything saying that it was canceled, so it it's still on for today? So we, we just have to give them time, you know, they do other jobs and * may have run a little over, so we have to, that's why we have those windows instead of just one specific time and we have to account for traffic as well. Mhm. OK OK. OK. OK. OK. So, well, like I said, I'll give them till about *:**, you know, I mean, which I can't make my run because it's already too late by then, you know. But, um, if they, they don't, uh, OK. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. Uh, I wanna find out because I have to make this call for tomorrow. I have to do it. And I, like I said, I would, I want to be here when the technician comes out. Yes. Right. Right. I understand. Exactly I do want to be here because the last one that came out, he just about told me he didn't know what the hell he was doing. He told, just about told me that. Oh Mhm. That's how bad it was. Well, hopefully we get some answers today and it's, it's to your liking and we can get this resolved for you. Yeah, so, but everybody. Great, that's good. Oh, OK, OK. And like I said, hey, I'm really sorry to have dragged you out for this, but there again, I like what you said that if it's not resolved, that you all can give me credit again. Yes ma'am, we don't want you to pay for something that you don't have. That's, that's not part of the contract. If it's not working, we have to put you on uh some type of uh either deferment or credit to the account. And so. Mm. Yeah. Well So you're not paying for something that you didn't receive. And see how come they never did. How come they never did that before for me? They never did it before for me because like I, yes, yes, like I said, they could see that the system was not putting out. That I can't speak to. I, I can't speak for anyone else. Mhm. But they never ever gave me a credit for anything. Mhm. So, you know, so, but uh I'll wait and hopefully somebody will show up or at least call me today, have, have the common courtesy to call me if they're not gonna show, you know. Mhm. Right.

4cfc303c-5916-4ea2-b67c-a7a3b90e5320,"Hello, how can I help you? Oh yeah, how you doing? I'm a um. I guess soon to be uh current customer for positing I was approved um to move forward but um. I am in second question about dealing with my uh contract and I'm thinking there with the with my situation so I I need to talk to somebody about that uh my contract. OK. OK, let me see, let me see if I, if I can help you out if I can help you out, we, we can uh we can uh direct you to your representative, but let me see if I can help you out. What's your phone number? Let me pull up your account. Because I don't, I'm, I'm really looking at. Uh, yeah, ***. Mhm. ******* All right, Keith. Yeah. Alright, OK, I have you pulled up. All right. OK [REDACTED]. Yeah. All right. Oh, so what, what questions do you have? Alright, so, Let me get, let me get this contract up that's what I was trying to do, um. First of all, my situation is, uh, I've been seeing that, um, in the state of Pennsylvania. Let, let me start off this way. When I first wanted to try to get sober, I looked into it through maybe my website of social media. There was a Mhm. Situation where they were saying that the state of PA gets a certain amount of money um that they give you for the solar and then there's the taxes that you. We'll get it back and also um some extra money of savings every single year. Mhm. Now withposits um that I'm realizing that I'm just leasing this, this, uh, stuff, uh, so and also I'm not getting anything back for taxes and also not getting anything at the end of the year or savings. I'm just paying a certain amount. Which is **.** close to $**.** dollars with the um. The bullies um of Pico cause they're never gonna go nowhere and uh Mhm. That's really the issue that I'm seeing that um. If if I wanna buy the soers down the line I can buy them, but. That Still It's not What I'm, you know. Seeing like I'm, I'm really not seeing anything as far as like I have, I, I wanna be able to do my taxes. I wanna be able to have a savings a little, you know, hey, $*** *** dollars, you know, at the end of the year each year, you know, you get money off your taxes too. I, you know, I own my own house, so therefore, you know, I wanna, I wanna be able to see a profit, um, then I could take the tax money and just keep paying off the, the solar, you know what I mean. Right. ***%. So, so, so Keith, so, so what you're looking for is, is to purchase the system, OK? Uh, when you purchase the system that's when you are able to, um, and I'm just being fully transparent with you, if you're able to then get the, the tax credit and all that stuff from it. Um, Every time I just But. Uh When you purchase the system, OK, so that's what you're looking for, um, you know, that's what the route I guess that you wanna take, um, which I can have your representative speak to you about that. I can have him give you a call if that's what you wanna just see what it looks like, um, but yeah, that would be, that would be the route you wanna take in order for you to take the benefit of the, you know, tax credit and all that good stuff. Mm. Oh, so with the representative guy that you know that I was dealing with, what he was saying, what he was saying was true is uh to to the certain fact of, OK, we, it's better for you to lease, and he's saying that you, you better to lease it out in your position or whatever because you know I probably couldn't get it through my um my credit. I don't know but um but I. Yeah. Right, so to purchase it, yeah, you do, you do gotta have a, uh, a credit score of between *** to *** and higher, um, and you also, in order to take full advantage of the tax credit, you gotta, you gotta meet the tax requirements. That requirement which is that? What is that? Mm, you, uh, you have to pay a certain amount of federal income tax, like, you know, when you work, you have a, you know, you get your W-*, you know, they take federal taxes, um, so like people that are retired or people that are, are, you know, have a monthly check, let's say like a disability check or Social Security check, those people won't, the, the purchase won't, uh, benefit them because they're not, you're not, you don't have the tax liability. Hm So as long as you have the tax liability, then, then you can lease, uh, then you can purchase, but that's why sometimes the lease is better uh because you won't even meet the, you won't even meet to get the tax credit. Oh, OK. Oh, OK, I see what you're saying. Mhm. Uh, yeah, OK, so that is making sense. In some sort of fashion, OK, so where, where my thing another thing, you know, then, now I understand that part. Alright, let's hit me with number *. Um, Yeah, right All right, let me, I'd rather, I'd rather answer, I'd rather answer all your questions right now, and I, you know, I'm, and like I said, I'm gonna be fully transparent, you know, it's not because I'm, I'm one of the project managers here, so my, my position is to be a voice for the customers with the company. So I'm always gonna be transparent like I just was now. I could have just been like said anything to you, right? But no, I'm, I gotta be transparent because hey, if you're meeting the tax requirement, yeah, if you wanna, you wanna get that go purchase it, but this is what happens, so I'm always gonna give you the pros and cons. No, no, it's not a bad thing. Now it's. Yeah. Right I Right, right, right, right, I hear what you're saying. Um, So, So go with your next question. Mhm. The second thing I realized was I, I, I, I have an EV car, right? Mhm. I have a a um electric car, right? And I know it's probably good for for the grid to. OK. Uh, whatever, but What I'm seeing now is that I'm gonna be really paying double for. Um, Not only the ** $** but I'm also gonna be paying another. $** or $** something dollars and it's still gonna be the same bill that I'm getting. Why do you say you're gonna be paying double? Uh, isn't it because I, I don't know why, but I heard that that's what I'm gonna be doing. Yeah, uh, let me see. Someone told me, uh, you know, exactly by looking at the numbers and they were like, you're gonna be paying for this and that. Um, let me see here. Let me take a look. And that's what I'm And because you're getting ** panels on your home. Mm. ****.*%. Mhm. Uh, blah blah blah blah. Yeah, I don't, I don't see where the $** would tap in, um, you know, of course, you will be paying your delivery charge and then whatever it's not covered by the solar. I'm trying to pull up your offsets not pulling up for me for whatever reason. Um, OK, delivery charge is that for the delivery of what? Yeah, that's, uh, your electric, your electric company we stay connected to the grid, so that's always gonna be a few dollars like anywhere from like $* to $* that we pay them regardless just because we're connected to the grid. Oh. So Um, and then when the, and then when your solar panels don't cover a huge, you know, ***%, then of course the remaining balance would be with, with your electric company. I'm just trying to pull up your offs and it's not pulling up for me for me to actually see what your. Yeah. What your system is gonna produce for you. Mhm. Um, but just so you know, and once I get it, if I get it pulled up, I can give you a call back, but just for like the simple, right, so let's say your solar system is gonna cover **% of your electricity and you're paying $*** you know that you will get the **% difference from the electric company. So then let's say you're, you are paying $*** and we're covering **%, and then you will see your bill, uh, with the $** of a difference for, for your electric company if you tap into that, right? Mm If your production, you know, let's say you lower your production or, or whatever, or now if you increase your production for what your panels are giving you, then yeah, you're always, that's why we stay connected to the grid. Um, but I can't speak, I can't specifically speak right now because I just can't see um what your system is producing. My computer is just not loading it, uh, for the system that they, that you signed up for. Mm. Um, OK, so call me back on that because that's like that is all. So Yeah, yeah, I can definitely follow up with you on that as soon as my computer wants to work. Alright, so, mhm. Mm. Yeah, I can as soon as it loads up I can give you a call and we'll discuss that. Alright cool but now what, what, another thing was um one more thing, and this is where I noticed. The default of you guys checking everything that needs to be checked on top of the roof. I told them that. The And I spoke to somebody and they said they were gonna call me back that the Panels, if you put them up and then Zoe in PA we get snow sometimes. Sometimes the snow accumulates on top of the panels. Mhm. OK, and there's no melting guard. Uh, I have a, a slant roof, and they noticed that, yeah, they do know that it's a slanted roof. Now they were going to change all the check the, you know, spotted roof to see what's going on, but they said everything's good with the roof. They're just gonna change the shingles. I have a contract right here that agreement where they was gonna tear off everything and da da da da da da da da, go through the process, na na na. Mhm. Um, Yeah, I know it's crazy, right? Now, now. Um, The problem was I told them that you know, recently I just said look, you know I got a slanted roof and I have a driveway where I keep my cars. I have a Tesla and I have a BMW, you know, I might switch to another EV car, but I'm sure it's gonna have a sunroof because we always like sun roofs. So, my cars are right there where the, the, the, the roof is, and I said, when snow, well, I, I let them know when snow drops down on the ground, it kind of hits the cars. Um, due to the fact. And I said y'all should have a a a a guard. A guard up there, man, because, um, a melting guard where it stops that snow from dropping like that, you know, whatever the case may be, um, the guy said, he said, you know, normally y'all don't do that. I would probably have to pay for it just then the blah blah blah, but he said, well, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get back to you and I'm gonna see if we can look into the budget. Whatever. I said fine. Do what y'all got to do, but to move forward. I'm not trying to have this crump of snow sliding off. The, the roof went, you know, it doesn't slide when you have the um the panel, I mean the um. The uh uh uh the singles up, it never slides, you know, you might get a little bit, you know, and it might fall, but it's not rock hard, but those panels I noticed are they are they are, I know they're slippery, and when that snow hits up there, it's coming right down. Mhm. Um, Whatever, whatever the case may be, sometimes it sticks and sometimes it doesn't, but when it does stick, what's gonna happen is, and if it gets thick, I say give us about ** inches, maybe *, you never know, we don't get that, that much bad snow now, but sometimes, you know, Philly is, is unpredictable. So when that snow gets a little thick and it stays up there, it gets hard. And when it gets hard, it turns into a brick. Yeah, so I'm, I can, I can only speak from experience with you. Uh, I would note, I'm gonna notate that and and talk to them about and see what they tell me. Um, I live in New Jersey, OK, so I, I get, I get a fair amount of snow. Um, has not had, um, and I'm only saying by experience, I don't know your pitch of your roof, so I, I'm not saying that. So, I said to myself, Oh Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I just want to give you that little bit of peace of mind. I do have solar in my home right now. Uh, my car is the same way. My cars are right underneath the driveway where my main panels are falling down. It has not happened yet for me. It's been * years. Has not happened yet, OK. Um. Right. It hasn't, it hasn't, uh, I have a slanted rule. Yeah, mine is really like they didn't even want to put so at first because I slanted my, my pitches. Yeah You have a slanted roof? Do you have a s OK. Um, but the only thing I say is, yeah, cause it's slanted. It's really like, really, and I'm glad it's over my garage area because if you think about it, how slanted it was on a, like if it was in a in a bedroom area, I would've, I would have, it would have been like an attic. Um. Right. Anyway, uh, hasn't happened yet, right? Like I said, um, hasn't happened yet, not saying that it can't happen, right? Um, but I will talk to them about that, but just to show what I've seen is when my panels, when it's on my panels, um, because the panels observing the heat right from the sun, right? The, the UV rays, right? Um, it's not, it's not absorbing the sun, it's not absorbing sunlight. It takes the, the UV rays. Um, with that being as warm when my snow is on it, it, it's literally like Oh Mhm. Right, right. Melting it. So when I see it's like it was my, literally it'll just stay right on the edge, which is very weird. It'll stay right on the edge of my roof, um, without, yeah, without falling down. And if it does start falling down, it's just water dripping down. That's how my experience has been. However, like I said, I, I will speak to them. I will let them know that's one of your concerns and see what, see what they tell me. Oh wow. Mhm. We Oh. Yeah. Yeah, OK, alright, so let me ask this, are you with posit? You, do you have this, this solar panel? I am. I am with Positon. Oh, you do have them. So how, how, how, how are you, uh, uh, are you happy with it? Yes. I'm happy with it and I'm not saying just because I work here. um, I'm, I am happy with them, right? It's not, it hasn't been, haven't had a bad experience, you know, as of yet, and I'm knocking on wood. Hopefully I don't. Um, I know that once my panels, when they first installed my panels, um, I had a little leak. Um, they came the next day, fixed it, fixed my roof, put panels, haven't had a problem since, um, so. Uh, do you have Right. Oh wow. Oh wow. So far so good for me. OK. Cause I, cause I'm, I'm not being negligent. I'm not trying to see negligent about this. Um, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to just get information, um, about the panels because I was. No, OK, listen, I get it. Your home is your investment. Uh, your home is your investment. You don't wanna just throw anything up there. You don't want, I get it. Especially not on your Tesla. Oh Yeah, I was Yeah. Yeah, I was Yeah, yeah, I was totally interested in posing and then I also told them that I wanted to uh be a worker, uh, uh, be for you guys far as, um, with, with, uh, one of the representatives did come into people homes and try to, um, that. Mhm. Them know what Positing uh was was doing positively or uh for people if you know if they were interested but it just I, I told her I said that's what I wanted to do so I guess I'll put in um application with you guys and whatnot and try to move forward um and whatnot um. Yeah, definitely. And another way for you to earn money for right now if you know you submit your referrals through the passage and mobile app, you know, right now, even just for somebody sitting with an appointment, right, just for them sitting, uh, taking the appointment and just sitting with us, us letting know what we can do for them, whether they take it or not, you get $*** for that, you know. So and if they do install you get you get another $***. Yeah Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. Exactly, but you know what, another. Exactly. And it was really no way really, another thing I was trying to do that on social media and, and whatnot, but I noticed that you guys don't give us a code and it's harder to, how can I put it, to, to You don't have the mobile app? I have the mobile app, but it's, but it, but it's not. Yeah, so It's, it's, it's OK, so I don't know how that works because it's like, OK, say someone is interested, they see the app um and whatnot. What, how do they y'all identify this? They say, oh this was uh Keith, this was. So you So you have to submit it through your apps so you have to get their information. Exactly. You have to really represent in, in, in information and call the people and let them know. Yeah, that's So all you gotta do is somebody's available. No, somebody is available, right? Let's say somebody's somebody wants to hear it out, right? Let's say you put on your social media and somebody DMs you, Hey, look, I'm interested, you know, you get their first name, last name, their email, their phone number, the city and state, right? They don't have to give you the address right away if they don't want to. They can give you the city and state, right? And you submit it on your app and they go, it tells me that, hey, keep submitted it. Mm Mhm. Mm. Right. So it'll go right to your account, right through, yeah. Mhm. OK So you just go on the app, you click submit referral or add referral. You put the information like that, you submit that and it comes over to us saying hey, um, Keith Clax went ahead and submitted a referral. Sure, OK. Mm. Right, and how can I start, uh, like, like I'll put an application in for you guys, um, how do I put an application in? What, what is the, the website, just positing and then you go to careers. Go to yeah, go to Pogen.com and go to careers and see what, what, what you're interested in. Alright, I see. Alright, thanks a lot, and, and I, well, I'm interested in, uh, um, uh, uh, actually just doing what the other guy did, you know, coming into people, uh, and just. Yes, yeah, so so it's, it's called, it's called the res, right? Um, they'll come up as a res RES, uh, on Posaggen or be like a, um, um, outside sales representative. Just look for something like that, and that's what he does. So Uh-huh. Or renewable energy specialist, OK. So, uh, click on that and then yeah, put an application. It's a great, it's a great company, man. All right. OK OK, so can you. Uh Uh oh, I, I do know it. I, I, I've got, I'm gonna be honest, I, I, I, uh, I guess I, I kind of like saw you guys this has been so this process has been about maybe almost a year. I've seen a couple of people the *st, *st last year and then this year I've seen, you know, the guy that came to my home or whatever the case may be. So I already talked to people, sat down with them and we say, and I was very, very interested through other companies that I did pursue and I, it said, look, let me see who's the best, and I realized that Positgen was given the best um out of all of those companies and whatnot. Um, and the. Only thing I didn't understand was the money that PA was supposed to give us. In other words, uh, they, they were telling me on social media that, you know, they give you money. $****. But the guy was telling me that that money is for the panels, Keith. Mm. Right. Right? He was, well, I don't know how it goes. Right, yes, it's only when it's only when you own the system, it's only when you own the system that it goes to. Ah, OK. Mhm. Alright, so let's let's see if we can try to own the system because so I, because I wanna try to put it in my wife if that's the case, if, if can my wife do it? Yeah. I mean, yeah, is she on the title of the home? But Um, She in the title in the home? No, she's not. But yeah, I gotta, I gotta ask because I think if she, if you guys are legally married we can we just add you as a secondary. Um, Nope, she's not. Yeah, we Yeah, we're, we're legally married. Yeah, um, I. So, and she has. Credit is better than mine, so at this point, you know what I mean, I gotta build, I gotta, I gotta build my credit back up. Yeah. OK, got you, got you. So Yeah, so that's what I, I was like, look, you know what I'm saying, that's on the panel so we could get, get our, our money back and then we could see throwing that money on top of the, uh, the bill. Pay up, you know, You don't get paid off, you know, I don't know how that works, but it is what it is. As long as she meets the tax credit requirement, then yes. OK, the tax requirements? All right. Mhm. Alright thanks a lot. I do appreciate it. What's your name again? All right. My name is Oscar. Huh? Oscar. Awesome Alright, uh, thanks, thanks a lot for the information. Uh, all right, brother.

Mr. Joseph, uh, look, uh, and that's not what I said. What I said was that's a whole billing, uh, it's another billing. It goes to the, the billing that's on your billing statement. That's where it gets processed at. We're in a whole another office. We're in Saint Rose, Louisiana where you send your bills at that's in Texas. So no, I cannot see when your payment arrived in Texas and when it gets processed, but once they process it in our system, then we can see it, but like I said it. And I understand all that, but the problem is they send you on this mission. Why? Mm, and I understand that and that's just, that's just what we have to deal with, you know. See, and that's what I'm saying, they sending you on this mission and you're blind and then you catching that smoke from me over this foolishness. I mean, it ain't no smoke. I don't, I don't want no smoke. I don't, I don't want no smoke. Cause after all those months it took to get this stupid system. What you need to understand, it took almost ** months to get the system fixed when it broke. So yeah, I got all the smoke for positgen. Just don't give it to me. Just don't give it to me. I got all the smoke cause y'all sure like to call behind some foolishness about a bill, but then it took ** months to get the system fixed. And look, And, and I understand your frustration, but at the end of the day, you know, you know. And I'm still waiting for my average billing with uh energy to stabilize. So I'm still paying more on my energy while it's still retabilizing for when that system didn't work for ** months. So yeah, I got all the smoke for posy and with the foolishness. Let me see. No, and I, and trust me, I, I completely understand, you know, I'm not against how you feel, you know, I will feel the same way, so I, I get it, you know, but at the end of the day, you know, the lady who called you, like you said, uh, in the account, the the the payment hasn't posted yet, so that's why she was giving you a call. It was just a courtesy, a courtesy call. Um, I'll let her know that you called back in to let, to let her know that uh you have sent the payment out and it was supposed to be delivered on the *th. I will let. Her know that um in the meantime, far as the bills, I can definitely take a look at that and see what's going on, make sure you're getting yourself back, but I do know since we did have those winter uh days that was uh from December to now, there was gonna be not much of a change in your bill, but now that it's getting back hot and the sun is starting to come up, you're gonna be getting more usage out of your solar panels because you do realize that, you know, you get more of your energy from the sun. And that's how you, you know, produce your savings and stuff. So now that we don't have any more, you know, memorial winter days, those have passed, you should definitely start. Sweetheart, sweetheart, you're talking to a retired physics teacher. I understand what we're dealing with. I'm not saying you don't understand, but I've tried to explain it as much as I could. So don't, don't, don't go through, don't, don't, I know, but I've already had these conversations. I understand darling. Mr. Joseph, I'm just doing my job. Don't, you don't, you don't have to, you know, you know, don't, don't do that to me because I'm only, you know, just trying to do my job and some people don't understand, so it's my job to explain it. But if you don't have any other questions for me, then we can go ahead and disconnect the call. Yes ma'am. Alright, you have a good one. All right you too take care.

I'm the owner of the contract, but I never signed anything that said that they did work here. Yeah. I have the If so, what what did they do?

You all got smart and sent me a copy of my contract again, telling me to read ****. Now, since y'all sent me another copy of my contract telling me my first payment was supposed. ****. That is what I expected to be taken out of my bank account, not $** because I'm already paying $**.** on a separate account for my roof being fixed for you all. And if you all did anything extra, then you should have told me about it. You should have divulged that information to me as what was being done and the date it was being done, and the time it was being done, so I would know about it also. Yeah. Mhm.

And they still didn't seal up everything because they left my dining room window broken instead of repairing it. They left the room, the window upstairs in my brother's bedroom open instead of repairing it.

b7798009-4c24-47f8-827e-033e902aa441,"Hello. Hi, uh, good afternoon. This is Aurel at Patti and Solar. Is this Wayne Palmer? Yeah, who is this? This is the rally with Passage and Solar on a recorded line. Yeah. Yes, sir. I was calling to introduce myself. I'll be your main point of contact for your project. And I'm gonna be following up biweekly, and I just wanted to know, how would you like your uh project updates sent to you. Some customers prefer email, others text. How do you prefer? You can text and email, there's no problem. OK. I, I can only, the system only allows one or the other, which, which one is best for you? You can text it. Text it? OK. So I'll go ahead and I'll text you my name and number just in case you have any questions uh before the update. And let me take a quick look and see where we're at with your project currently, OK? OK. And while I'm pulling that up, let me ask you, do you have the passagegen app by any chance on your phone? Uh, I downloaded but I didn't sign into it yet. OK, so what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead, I can send you a link that will make it easier for you to actually, it, it collects the data and it, it should have you uh log in quicker. Um, what kind of phone do you have, an iPhone or Android? iPhone. That one. OK. So on there, you're gonna be able to um see the project status. Uh, also, you're gonna be able to see um your, your billing statement in the future if you need uh to see that. And any payment that Posen uh sends you uh for referrals will be through the app only, OK? You do have to attach the bank account that you wanted to transfer. Um, OK, so you. OK. So currently it looks like we have the site survey scheduled for tomorrow between * and *. And basically, the um the technician will go out there, take a picture of the area that we're working in, bring that back and that's how we're gonna design your plan. And with those plans, we'll go ahead and get the engineer to stamp, OK? OK. All right. Um, do you have any questions for me? Um, no, ma'am. Um, one thing I did. Uh, Mhm. When they was reading it, they said that this is like not a replacement for energy. So if I'm not conserving. If I'm not putting out the energy. Um, That's just say After * or * months, * months down the line, and I'm not putting out the energy and I'm still getting a bill from energy and you guys, what, what, what happens then? So, uh, so the idea, so you're always gonna have a bill with uh a utility bill, that's, that's going to Right. Happen, um, because no matter what, unfortunately, uh, utility companies have to exist unless um something strange happened, but that's they just have to exist. We have to pay for the, you know, you're their service, a pole, a meter clock that you have to tie it into it. Um, now it's the only way, and I'm not sure if your salesperson explained this, but It is the only way to not depend on them ***%. It's, that's the only way because you're gonna be producing some of the energy that you're consuming, OK, that you're using. Um, now, if you use more, then at that point, that's where they're gonna bill you. So let's just say, and and just customers have to be aware of this, but you can't add a heated pool. Uh, because he size you without the heater pore, you see. Um, if you, if you add anything that's gonna take more energy, you're gonna need more panels. So, um, Right. That's, that's the thing, you just gotta be mindful that they size you based on what, how much energy you consume, you use now. The the idea of the panels and the only reason you someone go solar is to reduce their utility bill, right? And the only way to do that is by making your own energy. And the only way to make your energy is to have panels, um, but you just gotta be mindful, you can't just Use more than we make. Um, when you, when, uh, when they turn on your system, Basically, at the last step when they turned it on, turn it on. You're gonna get a call from our company and they're gonna provide you a link to monitor your system to take a look at how much you use, like how much are you making, how much energy, and you can base that and then look at your utility bill. Um, am I using more than I'm making? This is well, how much am I, you know, extra I'm using, so. That's how that works, yeah. I hope I, did I answer your question or did I not? Yeah, you, you did. OK, OK. Yeah. So you just like be mindful or just don't consume. I mean, the whole idea is uh to save you money on your utility bill. Um and like I said, it's making the energy you're using those, those panels, but if you overuse then at that point, yeah, you're gonna have a, uh, you're always gonna have an electric bill because of the meter, you know, that's, that's, that's the utility's property, um. And they're gonna charge you for it. That's just how it is, but yes, we're guaranteeing you a whole, uh, you know, after the year, um, you can have our office uh run a savings analysis and they will look at your utility bill, look how, how much, um, our panels, you know, produce, and then if they, if they didn't produce more than, you know. Then what we told you, if they don't produce what what we told you, they'll they'll credit you. They'll they'll they'll pay you out. OK. OK. All right, sir. So, um, need anything else? No, ma'am. I'm fine. That's it. OK, sir. So I'll go ahead and I'm gonna text you my name and number, like I said, um, I'm gonna text you the, the, the passage and app also. And if you have any further questions in the future, just give me a call or um you can text me, OK? OK, and what you say your name was? Uh, it's Ali, Ali. Oh, really? Yes. Yes, sir. Oh, alright. And I'll, I'll text you the spelling. OK. OK. All right, sir. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day, OK? OK, you do as well. Bye bye.

She's charity, um, we're having a bit of a concern. me Uh, we have a contract with Passaging, and I believe it's a legal contract. I signed for it because it was, um, the information on there was clear. Um, I was supposed to get my roofing done, my garage roofing and the whole house roofing repaired. That was what was stated on the contract. And um I signed for it because it looks good. So they've come in to fix the roofing on the garage. And I tried, um, so when I was speaking to the contractor about it. He was not aware of the fact that he was gonna do the house too, so I put out a contract. He took a picture of it, spoke to somebody and said they will come back and fix it. I said, all right. So they went ahead and finished the garage routine and I waited I waited for some time. It's not yet come to finish up the on the house roof yet, but they've come to install the panels which I'm very grateful. Only for somebody to call me later on to try to explain to me that that is not what was on the contract. And I said no, I can read and I can clearly understand everything that is in there. It said the whole house repair roofing repair, chimney flushing and all of that. And he was trying to um tell me that um it was only the garage that is gonna take the panel so it's only the garage will see that they will do. So I didn't, I didn't like I didn't quite get it well. I tried to speak to Byo today and I'm kind of frustrated about this whole thing because that wasn't how it was explained to me too so I said no let me speak to customer service and see what can be done about it. If nothing is done, I would also like to speak to the legal people because this is not good. And I don't understand why the guy was trying to tell me that it was only the garage. Meanwhile, the whole thing said the whole house roofing there. And, and it even says it on the invoice. That whole house included, like this is written on the invoice that they charged to him. So we just didn't understand where the confusion was coming from. So it's the work that was um that was charged in the invoice. Done or I'm sorry. Hello? Um, the document that they send you, that's the invoice for the work that the workers are supposed to come and do, right? Yes. OK, and then they came, however, they only did part of the work, and they're telling my husband that, hey, like we're not supposed to do the main house. My husband's like, well, that's a miscommunication because I'm looking at this invoice and it says the whole entire house. So I don't know why you guys are just doing the garage. And leaving the house roof. Like that's not how it was explained to me, that's not how it's written in this document, and then they're like, well, take it off the posit and it's not really our problem. So that's kind of what brings us to you. Of a contractor Contractors Yeah, sorry, it's really hard to hear you. I think you said the contractor. I, I said it because of something the contractor stated. Yes, yes, and somebody called me after. I don't know who that is, probably the boss of the contractor, somebody tried to tell me it was only the garage room, but it stated in the contract that the whole house too. OK. Mhm So I just wanna get this situated so um I don't have your your account pulled up.

30cad1ed-8c75-49be-8839-6d0cb51828c2,"Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Posen. My name is Joanne. Whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Yes, Joanne. My name is Jill Strain, and I'm an agent who's trying to assist our seller, um, who has solar panels through y'all. Um, we've called and we were given that um the buyers are potentially wanting to put a new roof on the property and so we called and we got a quote. It would be **** to remove the solar panels. What I'm trying to get clarity on. OK. One is, is, um, the, the seller doesn't have the funds so what we're trying to do is just um kind of pay everything out of her proceeds that active sale um and have it kind of go to escrow account to pay y'all um for then the buyer can get the things done is that OK or does it have to be do y'all have to be paid before active sale? Right. So the way that it typically works still is that we would have to receive payment in full or we could actually receive partial payment with approval like if you wanted to just pay um the removal and then we could pay for the reinstall it at at that point whenever you know just basically split it in half, but as far as receiving an escrow or promise to pay to pay, um, I haven't seen that before. I haven't seen that been processed with us before. Well, it, and we're not looking at it being done before active sale we're looking at it all being done after the active sale, so you just need payment before it's actually done. Mhm, yeah. So basically the the payment for us is that it has nothing to do with the sale of the home. It's basically for our technicians to be paid for the truck roll to go out and do the job. So whenever they're ready to move forward with that work, um, we, we can hold that invoice until the sale is completed if you want funds are released and then submit payment at that point. But, um, as far as I know our process is that the invoice would have to be paid for us to schedule the removal. As far as scheduling goes, I know we're about * weeks out. Got it. So, so if, if the actual removal, the actual removal is not planning to happen until after active sale, then you just need payment before it's actually scheduled and done. It doesn't really matter whether it's before or after. You just, you won't actually do anything until you receive the $**** kind of thing. Mhm. That's it. That's it. Yes, ma'am. OK, so it could ultimately be done after the active sale. You can receive the payment after the after active sale and then remove the panels, um, what. Yep. Mm Does it matter at that point I guess if, if the, because then the property would be under the new buyer's name and not the current seller, you know, the current seller's name as far as contract wise, but. No, not necessarily, as long as if, yeah, yeah, if the seller, you know, wants to share access to the invoice or or ask it to be reissued, that's totally fine. Y'all can still do it as long as you get the money. OK. There's no stipulation. OK. Perfect, perfect. OK. That's where we wanted to get clarity on that, um, because we're, we're negotiating going back and forth with this, but the seller just doesn't have all the funds that they're wanting and can't replace the roof. So we're looking at doing it at the active after the active sale, just put in the money and taking it out of our proceeds, and then the buyer would have the funds to do it and to do the solar panels and then put the new roof on. So, um, OK, perfect. And you said your name was Joanne, correct? Sure. That's right, yep. Thank you so much Joanne for your help I greatly appreciate it. You're welcome, Joe. I hope you have a good one. You also bye bye. Right.","The customer called to inquire about the process for paying for solar panel removal and reinstallation after a home sale.

Do I have to get a generator over top of this or oh no, in addition to this, um, solar panel I thought solar pan is supposed to help you when the power goes out. So what you can So what you can do is get a. Cause I know this, I was like cause I was excited. I was thinking that my power was gonna stay on and it went out right on everybody else cause I was **. I know, I know, um, so you would actually have to have a battery that stores the um the power to that battery and it'll be a backup battery and you can get the battery. We used to be able to give them to the customers but unfortunately, um, we're I think they're trying to process on how they can, you know, start selling them out again, but you can get a battery from a third party and it will be cheaper than getting a generator. And you will be able to use that. Yeah. So it's a battery and I'll be able to have power, and when the power goes out. So where would I, so how, where would I get the like what kind of battery is it? Cause I'm, I'm kinda lost on it, so at least I know. Yeah. That's correct. Yeah, so, um, let me see. So you can Google battery for a solar panel system and um it yeah and it'll give you some options from there. I will look up more recommendations and then I'll I'll give you a call back on what they recommend because they told us that you can get them for from a third party but they didn't give us any recommendations so I'll go ahead and um look for those recommendations and um give you a call or send you an email and let you know um what they say. OK. OK, so batteries was. OK. Yeah, if you could send me an email that'd be good because here's the thing like for I didn't know the house that I bought that um the second of the city I am they built like a new shopping center there so the problem that we have the grid, the part of the grid that we're on is that area that shopping center uses up on most of our electric so they kind of steals or drained our power from us. Mhm. Oh wow. And meaning that they have, we have frequent outages and I was like, what? Oh, that's, that's weird. That's weird. Yeah, that's some bullshit. That, that's bullshit. So. It is. I, you, look, I couldn't say that part, but yeah. Yeah, that's some bullshit. So that's why I was asking about it.

What's your, what's your address? My address is [REDACTED]. Got you. And you said this was done during installation? Mhm. Yeah, in the basement. OK. Cause I was cleaning the basement. I, I checked the cables, they go against the wall, and they could over it, you know, like, you know, they got like a white powder, you know, I don't know what's going on. I'm not touch. I'm living like that, you know. Gotcha. Gotcha. OK. Mhm. Got you.

Yeah, so I was gonna say, I was gonna say so I can see, uh, it looks like the system is, is, is putting out fairly well, but what I can't see is the expected energy, right? So I can't see what the panels are supposed to be putting out, uh, in comparison to what they actually are, and that could have potentially something to do with that wiring issue that you're referring to and truthfully it could have a lot to do with your bill as well, um, if it's not putting out a maximum capacity. So. Excuse me? I know. OK, sounds good. I, uh, I opened up the the system damage case for you here just sounds like there might have been a wiring issue. Um, I'm gonna send that over to our home improvement team and have us come out and try to get everything rewired for you. Uh, did you have a specific day that you'd like us out? Hey, any day, but listen, I don't know what the be coming like that, too high. Got you, got you. OK, let's see. I never have a bill like that because I only paid you guys and this bill come starting came out. Right. Got you. From people. Yeah I need to somebody at least go in the, in the roof and check it out what's going on, what they, what they look like because you know what I'm saying? Nobody going in the roof. Yeah, no, absolutely. You know? Got you. Yeah, yeah, I was paying upfront, bro. I always get, you know. Yeah. Uh, these two big, bro, one that one almost $** and now this coming $***. Getting up there, it's getting up there fast. My you too because I need to, I, I, I pay you guys too pantopaganda. $** too, you know, this is a lot of money, bro. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. OK, I just, um, I just opened up that case and I sent it to our home improvement team. Um, I went ahead and let them know what was going on with the wiring, see if we could try to get it rewired. Um, I know you didn't give me an actual like a specific date or time, so I just let them know as soon as possible, try to get done as soon as possible. Um, there was, what'll happen is once they get that date they're gonna go ahead and shoot you a text, more than likely to confirm it. If that date works for you, then you're all good to go. If it doesn't, give us a call back so we can try to get you another date that works a little bit better for you. What do you think about the ***, the beers and the pickle? I was gonna say that's a that's a that's a lot. What I'm thinking is that that's probably directly in association with that wiring, um, so it would be kind of difficult, I guess to determine specifically what could be causing it until, you know, this, this problem is resolved. Um, is this the first bill that you've gotten that's, that's that high? Mhm. I know. Yeah, bro. Got you, got you. OK, yes, so I would say, um, for future reference, I mean, I, I we're looking at, let's see, I would say, I would say we try to get this addressed first, see if we can try to get this taken care of, and then once this is solved, um, if the bills. You know, I'm I'm gonna assume that the bills are going to go down. So assuming that they go down, they're all good to go. If not, then we'll have to kind of figure out if there's something else going on. But I'm thinking this is, this is going to fix a lot of the problems because like I said, I'm also not able to see the expected energy from the system. um, so I'm expecting that to fix this problem and more than likely fix your problem as well as far as the amount that's that they're charging. Mhm. Mhm. Mm. And now I need to you the guy to text me the day you come over here to check out what's going on and you wanna figure out what happened to the bill too. Yep, yep, absolutely. Yes, sir. So I was gonna say, so that's how we're waiting for, um, just waiting for that text and then once, once you get that text, then we can kind of move forward from there figuring out what's going on with the system and what's going on with those, with those utility bills, sir. Oh, OK, for now I need to wait for you to text me, yeah? That's it. It shouldn't take too long though. It looks like, I was gonna say it shouldn't take too long though. It's just a wiring issue. It isn't, you know, I, I'll be a little more worried if this was, you know, roof leak or something that might require an inspection. It shouldn't take, it shouldn't take too long. The number you call from, is that a good number for us to contact you on? The date you're available for? Mhm. Yeah, ***-*******, yeah. OK. OK, alright, sounds good. So I'll pass that over to him, um, have them, have them give you a call if, if they don't reach you over a phone call, have them shoot you a text, let you know what day we have in mind. OK, bro, thank you and have a wonderful day, bro. I appreciate that my man. OK. All right. Yes, sir. You too. Have a good one.

Hi, I'm just calling because um I just got off the phone with my electric company and they had brought up some concerns about the solar panels that I have. Mhm. OK, I can certainly help you. So, um, well, Yeah, they're just basically saying that it doesn't look like they're producing. Producing anything as far as you know, me getting like any free months or anything like that so they just, they kind of just raised the concern and I kinda want to see if there was a way to. Mhm. Possibly look into it or get somebody, you know, overhead in my address, you know, in my residence to come and take a closer look at it to see what's going on. Alright, I can certainly take a look and see what's going on. Uh can I have you verify the name, address, and phone number on the account? Yeah, Steven Brian. At [REDACTED] Athol, Massachusetts. ***** And the phone number is ***-***-****. Thank you and I have an email on file as SB as in boy ***.**@gmail.com. Alright. Thank you. Alright, just one moment, let me take a look and see what I can find out for you verify the system is producing. Mhm. So it does look like the system opened the case. So there is gonna be someone coming out to take a look and see what's going on because it's not uh sending us a signal. OK. OK. So it wasn't So they're gonna come out and see if it's not producing. Ah, OK. And verify what's going on and we from there we can figure out how long it's been going on if it's just that it's not sending a signal or if it's not producing. Mhm. Yeah. OK, cause that's weird because I, I. But there is a case open. OK, cause I did call maybe like. Maybe a few weeks ago because I was also having problems with, I, I think something surging in my house and causing my bill to be, my electric bill to be like astronomically high and the only Mhm. Uh-huh. Oh. Other things besides the solar panels that I've got put onto a house that's new, um, is, uh, central air or heat pumps. So, you know, those, the solar panels and that is the only additional big projects that, you know, use up my electricity that I've put into the house. Nothing's changed and we've been here for * years and Mhm. Mhm. Right. You know, since getting the solar panels and those heat pumps, I've been noticing that my bill is. It's just been going through the roof, you know, it's, it's literally like, it's literally tripling. It Mhm. You know, uh, like, you know, and so it's a little concerning because I'm trying to figure out where this is coming from, where the surges are coming from, because, like I said, the solar panels and, you know, my heating, those are the only two things that I, that are new in, in the house, you know what I mean? Mhm. Uh-huh. So did you get the So something's going on and I just Which did you get first, the panels or the, the heat pumps? Good. So I got the I got the the panels first. OK. Yeah, so I got the panels first and then I got the heat pumps put on because we have solar so that, you know, we're supposed to be a good kind of. Kind of compromise I guess, you know, seeing that because we have the solar panels and it's supposed to be saving, saving us money but we're not saving anything, so. Mhm. Right. I'm just trying to verify. We, we tend to, we were tending to. Yeah, because when I did call the last time, the person I talked to, talked to last time I said everything was fine, and this is maybe like * weeks ago, so. Because they Mhm. Mhm. I don't know how I don't know if that was true or not or what, but, you know. Yeah. Oh I, I like your answer better with that there is something going on and somebody needs to come out because I know I because I, I've been living in my house for * years and we, me and my wife both work from home so we're not really going anywhere so we, we're home, we know what we're running constantly and like I said, the only two new things that we put on the house, you know, for, you know, for upgrades was, you know, the panels and that, that heating system. Yeah. Mhm. Um, But and now and the next step is I guess getting an electrician out here to. To kind of, uh, see if they can figure out what's going on. Right, um, I will say usually when you get panels, they go according to your bills that you currently have to determine the size of system you would get. Yeah. Yep. And when you add things, it will change your utility bill and the panels may not be able to cover that usage as well. um, but we still need to address, of course, the trigger. Yeah. Right. Yeah. OK, so yeah. I'm, I OK. Yeah, gotta, gotta figure it out because I mean as far as I'm concerned, these things are supposed to be efficient and they, you know, something's not being efficient, you know, not when, not when my bill goes from $*** a month to $**** a month. I gotta figure that out. Right. Oh wow. I don't, I don't know if that's just the panels. Yeah. That's a drastic job. No, I don't, I don't, I don't think it is either. Yeah, it's a big jump. I don't think it is either, but it's just good to get it. Right. Get it all situated so that we can point the finger at whoever it is and say, you gotta come, you gotta come and fix it. Mhm. Right, right. Right. So, yes, we, we certainly do have a case open. So yeah, it's so drastic jump and it's. Uh OK, OK. And it does take time for the system to trigger because it will wait a certain uh it has a threshold that it will allow something to happen and then that triggers the work order because sometimes your production information just doesn't load. OK. Yeah. OK. Like in that day. So we give it about maybe * to ** days before the system triggers anything. So, when it did that, it opens your case. Got you. Got you. Yeah. OK. So it could have just been like when you called, it was around that same time that. OK, do we know, do we? It opened. So it's been about, about *, *.* weeks. OK, do we have a an estimated time? I don't, but you will get a text. You should get a text message to let you know when someone's coming. If your system is not behind a locked gate, you don't have to be home. Of when somebody will come out here. OK. They will do the work. They don't generally need to get inside. So they'll be able to do whatever needs to be done. But I know you said you work from home. So, but they will come and take a look, do whatever they need to do. Sometimes we do use contractors, so they may or may not be in uniform. No OK perfect. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Yep. Nope, that's it. Alright, well I do appreciate your patience with us and we will get on this as soon as we can. OK, thank you.

95e2e225-1701-4d6a-9749-acbc2c04eeb1,"Good morning. Thank you for contacting Passenger. My name is Marianna. How can I help you today? Yes ma'am, uh, I just had a service call, uh, come the guy came out and told, told us that the, uh, panel was bad on our, uh, system and, uh, that it'd be a week before they come out to, to change it out, which is fine. I was just calling because they never did address anything other than what they're gonna compensate me on for the last year that my my stuff hasn't worked and all of the. Times I've tried to get somebody out there to come and nobody ever showed up until last week when I said if I don't get somebody out there next week, I'm taking them off my roof and then somebody shows up. Hm OK, can you provide me with your name and your address so I can look into your account, sir? Joshua, J O S H U A, Labot L A B A D. And it's [REDACTED]. OK, give me just one moment, I'm reviewing your account now. It I mean I'm sure you could tell on y'all and that that it hasn't been working in forever. And if you can, I can get a printout of all the bills from energy stating how it hasn't been working. I'm paying you all monthly for the system and still. $** a month or whatever it is $** a month on top of the fact that I got a $*** electric bill, so basically the panels are costing me money these days. OK. I'm gonna go. I'm not saving money. I'm, I'm spending more. *, so I do see that there is. These sources OK So I do see that somebody went out for today, is that correct? Yes. Yeah, OK, mm. Somebody went out today. They came, they got this, they got the panel to actually power on because I went over there when I, when I got home, I looked, I said they got it all still, so they didn't fix it because it said service call was complete on a text message and then I went inside I said hey. Did, did somebody knock on the door for the, for the panels? She and my wife said yes and they said that. They got it they got it taken care of, but they gotta come back in a week and change out the panel. I said, OK, and that's fine, but I mean they didn't call. I'm not gonna give me an update and let me know what's going on. It's just that the service call is complete, so I'm calling myself to find out exactly what the deal is and then I also wanna figure out what they're gonna do about this, like whether they just not gonna charge me for the next however many months. That they haven't been working and. Mm What what's gonna happen here because I'm, I'm not gonna. Something's gotta happen. I've been paying hundreds of extra dollars a month on top of a $** bill that y'all got, but you have these panels. So at this point it's almost crazy for me to even have them. OK, uh, what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm gonna go ahead and uh get in contact uh with um our diagnostic rep so that way they can determine how many months, um, or inform me how many months you haven't been, um, how much your system has not been producing for those past months. Um, and with that I can determine um. How much we can assist with the deferment for your account. Correct, like, I'm not asking for money back. I just want, uh, uh, if, if, if they ain't been working in a year, then I don't wanna pay for the next year because I've already paid and they wasn't working. I lost money. I paid energy $*** a month. You know, and I'm paying y'all $** that's $*** a month, you know, OK, well, hey, this is what we're gonna do once we get you back up and running the next * months or whatever it's been not working we're not gonna charge you that $** and then I'll be happy. I'll be. So I'll be happy about that, you know, but don't tack it on at the end of the note either, saying, oh, you still owe it. You know what I'm saying? Yes, I, I completely understand where you're coming from. um, as I mentioned we could determine it, it would be basically credited to your account so that means that um for the amount of time that your system was not producing or that it wasn't working, then we would provide um that that credit for for your account. Got you, and I'm good with that as long as they can actually do something and not just tell me they come in like they did the last * times and finally I got on the phone and I had to be a little not disrespectful, but I had to kind of say, listen, here's the deal. I've made * appointments. Nobody ever called back or showed up to my house. I'm this is not the *th time I'm calling if somebody does not show up or call me back by next week. I'm taking them off the off my roof and they'll be sitting in my yard for y'all to come pick them up and that's when I got somebody to come out. OK. So give me just one moment, Mr. Lobot. I, I com I completely understand where you're coming from, um, in regards to the system not, not working. Um, I can see how frustrating that can be. So I'm gonna try to reach out right now. I almost thought y'all was out of business, to be honest. I thought y'all was out of business just for a while. I haven't been seeing oxygen trucks nowhere. And I'm like, what the hell's going on? Did I just buy a system and these people go out of business and I'm still being charged? Cause my shit ain't working. No, sir. No, sir. Uh, give me just one more. I was starting to worry that for a minute and then, then when I had a kind of basically, I guess you say threaten them to threaten to take my shit off and, and return them. That's when everything started. I started getting some answers and, and things started moving. I'm like, man, it shouldn't be like this. Yeah, I, yeah, I totally agree with you and I do apologize for that, um, but I'm gonna go ahead and try to see what I can do on my end and see how quick we can get the deferment for your account, OK? OK. OK. And I'll be reaching back out to you um as soon as I get a response to see how how far long or how many months the system was not working so that way we can provide you uh with a credit to your account. I can tell you how long. It's been, it's been at least a year because That's the last time we had a storm event. And I remember going over on the side of the house when I was, uh, when my electrician was there hooking up, hooking up, uh, A breaker for a generator, and he's, and, uh, he said, hey, you know, your panels aren't working on. I said, what do you mean, yeah, it working. He says, no, this system ain't even powered on right now. I said, no shit. Well, that's when it brought my attention and I after the storm had passed through, I gave y'all a call the first time, nobody in. No, I got a call and they said, oh we're scheduling something now. Then I did that * more times and nobody, and I never could get anybody to come up. So if you would make a note of that as well, just because I appreciate you you helping me because obviously you're doing your job, um, but whoever was prior wasn't doing what they were supposed to do. I can tell you that. OK, give me just one. Because I own a business, if I don't reply to my customers, they're going elsewhere or they're gonna start bad mouthing me? OK, so at this time I'm just pending a response, um, from one of our team member, uh, team members so they can provide me, uh, with the amount of, uh, months, uh, that the system was not producing or not working so that we can provide you, um, order a credit to your account. Um, I will be contacting you as soon as she reaches out to me, so within the next day or two days I'll be reaching back out to you. Mhm. OK. OK, um, Mr. Lavitt, is there, you're, you're welcome. Is there anything else that I can assist you with for today? I appreciate it. That's it. OK, well thank you so much for contacting Postagegen and you have a great rest. Go ahead. Can you tell them, can you have someone, can you have someone give me an update on exactly what's going on with the system as well so I can know because uh I like to be in the know of what's going on. Yes sir, I can, I can notate that on the account as well. Just have them call me and let me know something or what what's the next steps other than them coming out to fix the swap the panel out and I'm gonna tell you when I got this system the day they installed it when I got home that evening, you know, they send you text messages, how was your install blah blah blah, all this good stuff. I said everything seems to be fine, but why did y'all put a used panel on my house? Y'all told me it was a new system. Oh well, uh, this was just a this is one we had taken back for nonpayment. It's still brand new. I said it's faded. There's no way this thing's brand new. Well, it was only on a, on a building for a little on on another house for a little while, and we was able to discount this one. Well, obviously the one they put on my house that was discounted come off of a house because it was broke. Mm. You know, and here we are. I'm paying for a used unit when it was supposed to be new from Jump Street. So all this could have been avoided if they just did what they told me in the very beginning and put the brand new brand new panel on from day one. But instead, they sent me a used one with use solar panels because I even questioned it. I said, well, this, everything looks good, but the panels are filthy dirty. I said, and, and the panel inside the house. It's faded. You could tell it's been installed somewhere before. Oh well that was a discounted system and all of that yeah well now I'm dealing with this with a broken unit for the last year or whatever. So if you would, can you tell him to put a brand, a new one on this time and not a used one? Yes sir I can notate it on your account um also are we uh. But That way I'm not going through this all over again in a few months. Yes, sir. I think that would have been the original solution from the jump, but I guess they, they thought otherwise and now they gotta come out and fix it. OK.

e2a72271-cfa9-4ca8-bae0-2a5a76fa4349,"OK like what place. Huh? Hi, hi, this is Aurelli at Passage and Solar on a recorded line. Is this Ms. Mary White? Hello? Mm. Yeah, they say Yes, ma'am. I was calling to introduce myself. I'm going to be your main point of contact for your project. So I'm gonna be following up biweekly, providing you an update and just wanted to know how do you want your updates uh to be sent to you? Would you prefer email, text? Uh, probably. Let me see, probably text. I do both. Do both if you can. OK. OK. Um, it, the system only allows me to do one or the other. Oh, OK. Oh, OK, uh. Probably text then, um. Thanks. OK. Sure, I can go ahead and what I'll do is I'll text you my direct number and my name. That way, if you have any questions or concerns before the update, you can reach me, OK? OK, and it says some Friday it's supposed to come out, uh, I think. And um, Uh, tomorrow I think. Let me take a quick look and see where we're at. Let me um OK. Let's see here. So yes, it looks like they're gonna be out there tomorrow between * and *. That's for a site survey. So that's the very first step what we do is we take pictures of the area that we're gonna work in. And then that helps us uh design um your solar system and once we have that design, we can go ahead and take it to the engineer. Oh OK OK OK. And, and let me ask you, do you have the Posygen app on your cell phone by any chance? Or do you need those? OK, got, got, OK, got what now? The Posseen app is an app. No, I don't. I don't. I can, I can send it to your, to your phone. That's not a problem. Uh, what phone do you have? Do you have an iPhone or an Android? Android. Android? OK, so I'm gonna send you this link. In this link, what it does, um, well, when you download the app, it's going to have a section where you see your billing statement in the future, you can also see your project status, um, and you can go also uh add referrals, which Which Posseen will pay you only through the app for referrals. So, right now the referrals, they're paying $*** per referral. So it's a, it's a great time to do that, OK? But you have to download the app because they only do the payments through the app. OK. OK. OK. OK. Um, uh, do you have any questions for me or? Uh I think I, I was **, my leg, um. They gonna, before they put the uh solar panels on, uh they will be checking the roof, right. Yes, ma'am. So tomorrow when they actually go there on site, they're also gonna look at that roof and make sure that um that it's in a good condition. If not, then they'll they'll document that and then they'll let the office know where um They'll send, they'll they'll see, uh, send you like um a write up of a quote or see what can happen. Uh, it just depends on how bad it is, if it is bad, if it's not, then they'll they'll just, they'll just look at that. Mhm. OK. OK then. OK, that's fine, that's fine. Yes. And you said an Android, correct? Yeah, and I know uh. Yeah, I got an Android. I got an Android. And he was also uh telling me uh that. OK. Uh-huh. I would pay the $** you know, uh, you know, for, you know, the ** days passed and then uh it'll be, you know, the **st payment would be $**. Mhm Mhm. Yeah, and we, we usually, well, I haven't looked at your lease. I, uh, usually when, whenever they turn on the system, like uh whenever you're activated, then you'll get a phone call and I will go through all of it. Actually, even before they, uh, right after, let's just say. Yeah. After the, the, the guy tomorrow, they're gonna give you a call and go over the lease term and everything. So you, you'll know, um, you'll get a final call like it's called final lease lease agreement. OK, OK. OK, and um, but how's your experience so far with our company? Oh, everything's been good, been good so far. It's been good. Wonderful, wonderful. So great. That's good to hear. Just we just like to get um you know, write down the feedback and if there's anything we can do better, just let us know. Um but again, like I said, even like after right after that site visit, they'll call you then even when you turn it on, when they turn you on, you'll get another phone call that will explain everything when the bill's due, they'll go over your monitoring, like how to monitor your panels and all that, OK? OK. Now, is this, is this with, I was gonna ask you, is this with your light bill or is it gonna be two separate bills? It would be two separate. This would be just your, this is just for your panels, um, your utility, it just depends on like, you know, how much, how much your energy, your panels produce and like whatever they don't, like, whatever you use more, that's what your what your utility is gonna bill you. OK, OK, yeah, that's that's what I was wondering. Mhm. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, cause I, so I see, yeah, that's what I was wanting to how, you know, how you can work, you know. Cause uh like I said, the um light bill, it would come out. Mhm. Now, I want to ask you this, OK, the light, OK. The $** is coming off my card, but uh that's a separate bill because see I'm that's what I'm trying to find out is I need to be looking. Mhm. Uh, to two different bills instead of on one bill. Cause see, uh, the, the people in my house, we, uh, Yeah. Slit, we kind of split the bill, so I need, I'm gonna have to need to know. Uh, well, I'm gonna have to see how, you know, to work around. Cause you, we mostly pay the bills on the *rd. Mhm. And I was trying to make sure that that bill come out around about the time the light bill come out. Oh, OK. Um, so, Whenever they, I don't know if they set you up yet, but usually whenever they set you up with the bill, it's usually the *st, the *th, or the **th is the dates that they'll like give you to be drafted. Um, so I'm not sure which date um if they set that up yet, but. OK. I think I picked, I think I picked, I think I picked the **th, but I was thinking I didn't, I was, I didn't know that it was two separate bills, so. OK. Oh, OK, OK. So I, yeah, yeah. See, I was thinking that it's all gonna come on ** bill. Oh, OK, OK. So I need, yeah, I might need to have that to come around when the light bill come cause, well, well, actually, the light bill come out on the **th. I mean it's due on the **th. Oh, OK. It's due on the **th, so that make that y'all been then took y'all part out before I got before I get the idea. OK. OK. Yeah, and, and, and, you know, if ever you want to change it, you can later on, uh, we can send you a link and you can change it um to a different date, and you can change whatever, you know, account to, uh, however you want to do it, but yes, it would be two different bills. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. So Alright. What I'm gonna do is go ahead, I'm gonna text you the link for, for the um for the referral, you know, uh and also for, for our company link, and then I'll go ahead and send you another text with my name and my phone number, OK? OK. All right, ma'am. Well, it was a pleasure speaking with you. Just wanted to make, you know, let you know that I will be following up every * weeks, giving you an update. Hey, this is what we're doing, this is how long you should expect, or hey, this is what we're waiting on, you know, and um just, just giving you an update so you're not just waiting there and, and, and thinking we're not, we're not doing anything, OK? OK, OK. All right, Ms. Mary. Well, thank you so much for your time. All right. All right, see you later. All right. Have a wonderful day. Bye-bye.

Um, would you like for for me to just leave a message for him? We are in the process of selling our house. And we need y'all to email us what the procedure is. For the buyers to transfer the policy? The lease. It's OK. We need to have a communication that says yes it's transferable and this is what the buyer needs to do. OK, um, so as far as the lease transfers, um, the, the process is the customer has to assume the lease, so, um, the information that's requested from the from the buyer would be his, uh, basic information it's like an application that they have to provide to us in order to create an account, um, and then uh we would basically send out a lease assumption to the the buyer, uh so they can sign off on. Um, but there is other options as well. Uh, currently I do see here that there was a temporary uh removal for the panels, is that correct? We are. The first buyer we had didn't want the panels, so we received an email saying what we needed to do in that situation. Now these buyers want the panels to be put back on. And assume our lease, but they want to have something in writing from you all saying that yes the lease is transferable and this is what you need to do. OK. Um, is there? And if there's something we need to fill out we need to know that but. You know it right now the whole closing is hinging on getting this stuff from you guys. And I don't wanna lose the sale because we can't get something. OK. For them to understand. OK. And evidently this is something the bank is requiring. Contract, OK, so in this case then um we do have to have a set up for whenever or schedule uh to have the system reinstalled because I do see here that it's currently uninstalled. Um, so that has to be completed first. Right. But we don't want it. But we don't want it reinstalled for us, we want it reinstalled for the buyers. Co Correct, um, do you have any information regarding the buyer like their email uh name so that way I can go ahead and send over some information to them? No. I can give you my realtor's information and she is contacting them. We're still dealing with realtors we're not dealing with them one on one. Oh, OK, um, if you like, I can send you an email. That's the problem. I can send you an email and provide you with the details of what um what needs to be completed in order to transfer over the lease. Uh, the email address that we have on file is DVsteens**@gmail.com. Is that a good email for you? OK. DD Stevens. D as in Dog. V as in Victor. Stevens **. At gmail.com, yes. OK, um, so I can go ahead and send you an email of what exactly needs to be completed in order for us to transfer over the lease, um, but if the, let's see. Once we send them that then I think they will contact y'all and do what they need to do. But they just need to say yes this is assumable as opposed to us just telling them it's transferable. I've sent them a copy of the lease, but the bank is just being. Difficult OK, uh, so give me just one moment. I'm gonna go ahead and send you an email at this time and I just want to ensure that you, uh, receive it, OK? Give me just one moment, Miss Stevens. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. You are on hold.

No, let me check. OK, I'm gonna send this to them and we'll see what happens. OK. Well, So, uh, but you don't need anything from us, correct? No, no, ma'am. OK. OK, well let me try and do this um. And see if this will be sufficient. OK. Thank you so much for your help, Mary Anna. You're welcome, Miss Stevens, and if you have any other questions or concerns you can always give us a call back.

I'm sorry, where are you calling from, hon? I'm calling from Posogen on a recorded line for quality reasons. Oh, pause it again. I'm sorry, my stupid car. It's, the volume is so low because of the fan. OK, let me see if I can turn down the fan. All right. There we go. All right. I can hear you so much better now. Oh my gosh, my heater's on. OK. How's it going? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. It's going well, thank you for asking. How are you today? Um, I'm good. I'm very glad to hear from you guys because I was starting to wonder, um, what's gonna happen next. Oh, what's, is there something, maybe I'm out of the loop? What, what's happening? So the, the solar panels according to my electric bill are not generating. Mhm. And I called, I don't know like * weeks ago and they said. I can see, yeah. And they said that hey we're gonna get you on schedule and there's there's a whole bunch of other things I haven't been comfortable with this since the whole beginning um so now we've got panels that are if I read between the lines they're not guaranteed to generate. Mhm. Mhm. And then I've been trying to get Someone to come out to fix it. And here we are and because I was told it could take * to * weeks, yeah, I, I was told it could take * to * weeks to even get on the schedule, and I talked to Juan then I film in he said I'll, I'll be reaching out to you. I never heard back from him again, so I called. Right. Still waiting for a date. Yeah. Mhm. God Lord, last Monday, I don't even know what day it is. Um, last Monday or Tuesday, yeah, because I gave him, I gave him an extra day. I was like maybe he's busy Mondays are crazy, um, and so I had another gentleman say he was gonna get back to me by the end of the day and I didn't hear from him, so. Yeah. Last Tuesday, I can see it. Yeah. OK. Here we are. Yeah, I can see that he um reached out to um he reached out to someone in the scheduling department I can see that notation here and they must not have gotten back with him because I don't see any further notation for him um this is what I was gonna do because I do see the communications cases open um. And let me see, did you send, did you send your bills in to anyone here? Electric bills? No, so they told me that, oh no, we don't reimburse you electric bills. The first person told me they did and then the next person says, oh no, no, we just reimburse you the $*** and whatever dollars Dan gets charged, and I said, OK. Mhm. Yeah. And that's fine. I just, I'm, I'm, I'm like at a loss because the bill came through last month and said, hey, it must be generating cause they said to me they won't charge me is what he said. He said they won't charge me till they know that it works. They do this ** day grace period, and I said, Oh well, that's good. And he said, don't worry about the electric bill. I said, are you sure? He said, Yeah, no problem. Well, now Amy has a $*** electric bill that she has to take care of, um. Yeah. Because yeah, because the payment plan got broke and now I'm like, well I feel stupid and he's like, oh no, it'll it'll work it'll work once they get it to connect again it'll work so I'm like I'm still on the hook for this dance. I still have to pay this, so I don't know what to do. Like according to Dan, they were supposed to fix the leak in the room. The leak was never fixed and then when I talked to the contractor, she's like, oh, that was never in the original contract. We cleaned and repaired your chimney for free and I'm going, ma'am, nothing's for free. But however, I digress. I know you can't do anything about that. I just, I'm, it just feels very shady. Yeah. OK. OK. Mhm. Um, and now I've got a system that is on my roof and I'm worried about the integrity of the roof with all this weight on it, and it doesn't work like it doesn't work. It's just, it's just a paper weight on my roof. Mhm. OK. I can, I can address a few things in that. First, I'm not sure who Dan is, so I'm not, I'm, I'm guessing those who, OK, um. Oh, that's my husband. Dan is the guy who signed the paperwork. That's my husband. He's the brilliant one who thought this was a great idea. That's it. Yeah. OK, so, um. Um, go on. As far as um roof leaks or anything, I don't show anything here about a roof leak, but if that's something that you guys address with Power Energy Solutions, who has installed your panels, then I wouldn't see that. So I'm not sure if that's who you addressed that with. So that's That's whoever he, so you guys are like the sub of the sub, right? So the lady who came out to sell this whole Dr. Pepper elixir said, oh, you're gonna pay this and you don't have to pay your electrical anymore, and he did it, a flying sinker. Right. Mhm. And so that's the one who supposedly told him, we're going to fix your roof leak. It's gonna be fine, and we're gonna clean it and we're gonna patch it. It'll be perfectly safe. And um after the installation, all kinds of electrical problems came. They, they Mhm. had to put a down rod in the ground and it blew a fuse in my house to where it burnt my air fryer. I mean, I could go on, honey, for forever, but whatever I can do to either get these things working or undo this madness because one and something's got to give. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. I can tell you as far as us, we do not expect you to pay as long as the solar panels are down. As long as they are not working, we do not expect you to pay at all. So, the who, the person who you spoke with here with us was correct. OK. We cannot give you any help on the electric bill, but we can give you anything that you've paid to us back as a credit. And if maybe you're down longer than what you've paid us, then we would do a deferment. The deferment just puts everything on the back end. But bottom line, we do not expect you to pay while the system is down, which is why I was asking about the electric bills, because what I can see here. OK. OK. OK. It looks like a communications issue, but we can't tell about communications if you're also producing unless we see your electricity bills. So I'm gonna send you over an email requesting to see your electric bills because let me see how long you've been. Right. With this November I think November. So, it hasn't been long at all. And he got billed It's, I think November it got installed or September and it got turned on in November, right? And then March, I think he said the first bill came through from February or March. Mhm. Yeah. OK. Yeah, so, and that's actually the only one that's been paid, it's been the March bill. So any credit that I give would only be for that one month. Any other time that you need would have to be a deferment, OK? Um, and that puts everything on the back end. Yeah. Right. Listen, I, whatever, whatever it is, I really, I really don't, I really don't mind or care because it's not. As long as it's fixed, yeah. It As long as it's fixed, because at the end of the day, I'm, I'm going to take my battle and this is not the hill I will die on, but um I just want it to work and I want it to work soon because, you know. Mhm. OK. It's, it's irritating because I. Yeah, cause the electric bill is crazy. Yeah, so it's either one or the other, and then also I think I'm gonna have to have a roofer come up and I can't have them come up if there's panels up there covering the roof. So I need to know if this is going to stay, then it's gonna stay then I need to get a roofer and coordinate how to get it, you know, how to get them access, but it's not gonna stay because it's not working for whatever reason, then we need to coordinate removal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna send you an email requesting the last * bills. The email address that I have on file is actually Dan. It's the lesser**@gmail.com. Do you have an email address that you'd like me to send this request to? Yeah. You can send it to Dan's. I have access to his email. Um, I, I, because I got the, I got the contract one sent over and I was like Dan did not read this because it's not a rent to own. It's a lease that you have the option at the end of the lease to purchase. He has no idea, so, um, this person told him at the end that he can transfer it to the next owner, blah blah dah dah, and he doesn't own it, so, um, I don't. OK. Yeah. Yeah. To buy, yeah. Yeah. Can I ask you a question? I don't know if you know this. If, if it were to be, if it, if I were to request it to be removed, how much would it cost, uh. Huh. To have it removed. If that had to happen, how much would it cost us? Well, this is the unfortunate part because we want to be able to get it fixed so that everyone is happy because the unfortunate part is with, with our organic customers here, not our partners, you have a *-day window from once you sign the contract in order to cancel. So if you don't get it canceled within Yeah Right. ** days you are technically locked in. Of course there are options or things that may occur before installation that if you wanted to have them um to cancel before actual installation and we could do that. So I assume that will be the case for you guys as well, but once everything is installed, you are pretty much locked in, which means you would have to pay out the contract. For ** years. Yeah. For ** years Not **. I hope it's not ** years. I'm showing that. I swear to God I think it said ** years, so I, so you're saying we're screwed to have a system on our roof that doesn't work. Maybe you were thinking about the amount because I'm showing the total, maybe you're thinking about the contract amount, but it's, I don't, I don't believe it's gonna be ** years, no, ma'am. Um. Maybe. Cause I, I cause I remember reading and I was like, dear Jesus, because I read that you can remove it, but it would be the cost to remove it. Mhm. No, ma'am. So I wanna know how much that is. That's not what it says. All right, I need to read over this again. Jesus Christ. Oh, excuse me, he is such an idiot. Yeah. No, that's, yeah, that's not what it is. So you would still be responsible. For the He's and here's the thing, I'm, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I'm co-owner of this house, but it didn't require me to sign this contract so what disturbs me is that he can make a unilateral decision without the other owner's consent. That's what's really scary because now I'm quasi financially responsible for something that I didn't want, so I just wanna make sure that I'm tracking that is that. It's OK. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, and I'm course picking up my kit, so let me see if I can find this in the email. So you're saying there is no way to have it removed. Uh-huh. Yeah. So the total number of amounts is *** payments. OK. That's the total amount. So divide that by, that's **. That is a long lease. Dude, this is bull. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, hon. I think this is an absolute crock of crap. There's been so much damage to things in my home. It broke my heater. It broke my air conditioner. Yes, the electrician came out, but they didn't replace my air fryer. They didn't replace my kids' electronic stuff that they broke. I mean, I'm sorry, but this is absolute malarkey, and I'm, I'm a really That's a long way. Mhm. Easygoing person, but I don't think I've ever been this miffed um about something so just because you guys are powering what the heck are you guys? You're positivegen right? so. Mhm. We're positing, yeah. Power Energy Solutions is who installed it for you. So I got All right, and that's the contract that I have because it says. Yeah. So. So initial term ** years. No no no no. *.*% each year. Ownership. Must notify us properly about potential warranty claims. Oh God, of course. I'm sorry, hon. Are you customer service? Are you contracts? What, what is your role, dear? No, you're OK. I I'm neither. I'm actually the account manager for payment when everything happens, but at the same time, I do like to make sure that everything is correct. I don't expect my customers to pay if their system is not working. So that's the reason why we want to go over and make sure that, um, everything is as it should be. Well, I appreciate that. And I can't do anything about the contract itself, but I can let you know what the terms are there. So if you decide you want to have them removed, you'd be responsible for the total cost of the lease, minus whatever you've paid. So that would be $**,***.**. That's, I know, right? So that's right there on the lease. OK. Jesus Mary Joseph. Holy jumped up Christ. OK, so you, you may elect to have the system removed and pay us a fee equal to our labor, equipment, overhead permitting marketing, and other associated costs to remove, remarket and redeploy plus any applicable taxes. So that cost of removing. Said paperweight is equal to the lease is what that's saying because I feel like that's not very clear, just so you know. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. So Oh man, this is um. That's, um. You're more than welcome. How many people get roped into this? Like, oh my God, this is bad. I'm sorry, this is bad. This is bad. It No, I understand. I completely understand your concerns. My main thing is making sure we get the system working for you. So that's what I'm gonna work on doing right now for you, OK? So, I'm gonna see. I hope you can. I hope you can because Oh good Jesus. I'm reading this dude. Oh my God. Yeah, see if we can get somebody out there. Yeah, please, because Yeah. I am just End of initial term renewal termination. Well, I'm giving you a ** year ahead, um, notice when it's been on there ** years if I'm still kicking, please get it off the damn roof because um. Yeah. My God, my kid will be right. I'm sorry, I don't think anyone should be able to put a permanent fixture on somebody's house without both parties agreeing. I really just. Yeah. I don't think you should be able to do this early purchase, how much, how much is early purchase? I'm curious. Yes, ma'am. But it's still the, whatever the cost of the lease is, that's it. So, what happens is at the end of your lease, if you wanted to purchase, we would determine whatever the fair market value is of the panels. So, um, if you decided that you want to purchase them, we would have to determine whatever that fair market value is. If it's more than what your lease amount, of course, we would put. Um, that amount of your lease plus the difference, um, if it's less than what your lease amount is, then you may be able to do that. That's what our organic customers, but with our partners with Power Energy Solutions, I'm not sure if it's gonna work the same way. OK, again, so we're subcontracted from this other company um. Yeah. Yes, ma'am. OK, alright, so. Alright, yeah, find out what you can about getting somebody out as soon as possible and then I'll go appeal my frustration. Yes, ma'am. Now, I did email you requesting those last * bills so I can check for any sell back and then any credit or deferment that I can apply to your account, I will, OK? So if you could just whenever you can. OK OK. Well, it's only $*** hon. Don't, don't go crazy. Don't go crazy. It's only $***. Yeah, but either way we wanna get it where it needs to be, you know, so either way, OK. No, I get it. I get it, but I again, it's, it's *** bucks. I'd rather get that sent back to his account for penance for this madness, but I don't think you guys are gonna be able to do that, right? You're not gonna refund him. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. It's either gonna be a credit or a deferment for you. Yes, ma'am. Alright. That's fine, yeah, just credit whatever, whatever you need to do, um, so I'll send. Yes, ma'am. I, I just need to see the bill so I can see that, OK, if you can. OK. Oh yeah, yeah, I'll send the bills because I've been looking at it and he's like oh it just needs to catch up it just needs to catch up and I'm like that doesn't make any logical sense. So um I will, I will send those to you so what do you need for me to move forward with getting people to my house? Yeah. Uh, nothing. I just need to get in contact with our field services team to see who's gonna handle that. If it's someone from our team, if it's someone from, um, Power Energy Solutions, either way, and we need to get it scheduled. That's it. But the same thing that Corey did for you last week, it's just me. I have to reach out to them and then we do have to wait for them to reply to us unfortunately I'm sorry. I Yeah, that's what Juan did too. Yeah, I mean, here's my question to you is how long can I Yeah. For them to agree to it, and I please don't mean, please don't think I'm meaning this meanly. Are they expecting me to wait ** years to have this fixed and scheduled because what Juan basically told me between the lines required to work. Mhm. OK Say that again. So Juan said in so many words, the system's not required to work. So how long? Should we anticipate this to be leading somebody to fix it because you're the *rd person. So I want to say that's untrue, right? So what he maybe was trying to tell you is that what you are paying us for is for the solar panels for the equipment or working equipment. You don't pay us for the production. The production is a plus. That's why you get the panels. That's the whole purpose of it, for to be able to produce energy and you'll be able to save on your electricity bill. But what you are paying us for is the equipment. It needs to be working equipment. If the equipment is not working, we don't expect you to pay for us. We do expect you to give us time to get it fixed in order to give us time to make it right. That is what we do expect. OK. But we don't expect you to pay for equipment that is not working. So I'm not sure if that was the right way for him to explain that to you. OK? OK. I think we were going through the minutia of the contract because Dan said that they guaranteed it to work or they wouldn't charge me and that it's guaranteed to generate and he's like, well, not really. I was like so so I I guess technically you're both saying the same thing but um. Mhm. No. Mhm. At the end of the day, it is what it is, but you know, I thank you for listening. Um, so, but I'm not crazy. That is a long contract. I saw I could do math, you know, it's very long and it's not, and it's honestly, it's not financially beneficial for us at all because our electric bills aren't always $***. So I don't know whoever did the math. That's not right. Yeah, no, I completely understand. It it's very long. It's very long. It's very long. Yeah. Um, I know because I pay the electric bills. I'm the one who pays the bills. So, um, I really hope that, see, here's the other question too, is that what if Dan doesn't pay this bill? Yeah. You know, what if this bill doesn't get paid this whatever $***? What happens then? Mhm. Does it go into collections? Do you take it? Like, how does this work? Because he didn't explain that to me. He's like, it's not gonna happen. Yeah, at a, at a certain point we do. At a certain point we do take it. It does go into the collections, um. OK. But we, our collections is in-house though, so. OK. I got you. At a certain point, it does. I just wanted to know Yeah. Because he thinks he's buying it, just so you know, he. He's like, oh, I'm renting to own it. That's what she said. You're gonna own it at the end. I'm like, no, she saw you coming. No, the the, the girl saw him coming. She is a slimy businesswoman. I, I, and I, and I believe that cause I think that unless he heard what he wanted to hear, and let me, let me give her the credit for that. Maybe he heard what he wanted to hear, but I heard, I heard they were fixing the leaking roof because how can he put something on a roof that leaks. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Yeah. Do you guys put things on roofs that leaks? So No, so you're saying the roof was leaking before the panels were installed? Exactly, and I said, Dan, we can't put things on a roof. There's a leak in front of the chimney. Oh, And he said they're going to fix it, Ames. They're going to clean the roof and they're going to patch it. And I said, Oh, OK. So there was a dude on my roof when I came back from a business trip in September. He didn't answer me when I spoke to him and I was like, Oh well this is just cute. So when they were installed, the inspectors came out after the debacle with the electricity. They turned it on. This was I guess October, November, right? And Mhm. We got a nice big rainfall and the roof was leaking and I said, Oh well, I thought it was fixed. He's like, oh, I'll reach out to her. He never reached out to her. And I finally got her number from Home Power Home Energy Solutions, and she texted me and she said that it well it wasn't part of the. Mhm. We did that for free. We cleaned your roof and patched your chimney for free, and I'm going so you can put it in with a leak. So I'm asking you, do you have any documentation that proves that my roof was safe for installation? No, ma'am, and we wouldn't have that in that proof, um, that will be something that Power Energy Solutions would have, we wouldn't have that. So the other the other company, OK, that's what I'm trying to understand is that. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Would you think that they could put something on a roof that doesn't Have, you know, I don't know. Anyway, what, um, I, I don't think I, I, I wouldn't, I would never suggest putting pen on a roof that was already, um, structurally unsafe or already damaged. You know, I, I don't know. That's what I thought, but I don't know, I'm just a therapist. I don't, I don't fix roof, um, so what do I know? But he's like, no, no, no, you put it on the, the rafter thing. I don't forget the word he used. But, um, I'm like, yeah, but it's still wood and wood still can rot if there's a leak on it. The roof is from God knows how long ago, um, and they're like, oh, they're gonna get a grant, they're gonna fix our roof because something was New Jersey and they're gonna do this, and I'm like, whatever. Well, I wouldn't. Yeah. Yeah. So I just, I will send you, you see, you said you need * months of elected bills. Mhm. * months, um, so this month March February, or do you need from October? Um, let, let's go from. Let's do your first payment was March, so let's do um. Let's do February, um, January, February, March. Let's see about there, OK? Let's go there. OK, alright, I'll I'll send those. I'm just trying to think of usage or billing month because you know how it billed you for the month before. Mhm. OK. OK. All right. So we've had a very long conversation. I shall send those. Yes, I'm so sorry. There's a, it's been, it's been a really arduous process and I feel like it's been not very fruitful. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, um, I can only apologize for our pardon here. What I'm gonna do is uh. No, and you don't have to apologize. You're a human being. You have nothing to do with it. This is people who are just unscrupulous and they prey on the fact that people just don't know better and it's sad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, um, what I'm gonna do now is again reach out to that field services team, see if we can get a date for when someone is gonna come out, um, and whenever you get me those bills, I'll take a look at them to see if we need to do a deferment or anything on your account and then we'll check work on a date and again I do not expect you to pay until we get your system fixed now there is paperwork with any deferment. Not necessarily the credit because it's a low credit but with the deferment there is paperwork that I would have to send you, OK? um but the main thing is we wanna get the system fixed that's the main thing, OK? Yeah, I mean, deferment that makes no never mind to me. You can let Dan deal with that because it is what it is, but I'll send you the paperwork to make your life easier. I just don't know what he wants to do, but I'm gonna look into the to the roof thing because that concerns me. Mhm. Mhm. OK. Yes ma'am. I, I'm gonna get with my um supervisor because that may be something that we need to schedule for you as well on our side, OK? Because with all of our other partners, we do service the panels in from everything we service it all so I will see if that's something that we do as well for you guys, OK? OK. OK. All right, thank you. No problem. Thank you and you have a great rest of the day, OK? You too take care bye bye. All right. All right, bye-bye.","Customer called to report malfunctioning solar panels.  They expressed frustration with lack of responsiveness from previous contacts and concerns about billing and roof damage.

I have a phone number ***-***-**** and an email as Herbert Wallace**@gmail.com. Is that correct? Yes.

For the beginning of May, OK. Alrighty, uh. And how much you said that was gonna be per month? I'm sorry. Uh, we have here $***.**. Because the reason why I ask is because with the, the thing that they they broke down the the payments and stuff like that it's showing *** is that without a tax or something? Oh, I'm, I'm not sure what I, what we see here is the ****. Let me just double check. Let me look at your agreement one more time, OK? Just one moment. OK. He might, they, you know, the, the rep must have broken down a, a, a different way, but I'm gonna show you what I have here. Uh do do do do. Yes sir, I have it here as *** with ** cents on the agreement. *** and ** cents. ** cents, right? Yes, sir. Yes sir. OK. Now, and you said the first payment is gonna probably be due around the first of May like that's when the first one will come in. Oh, Yep. That's correct. OK. So, so, OK, so my other question is be now, so what happens now as far as what kind is concerned? Yeah, so, uh, all the paperwork was submitted for them. So what happens now they'll, they'll send you your, your bill, you know, for just to being connected to the grid, which is a few dollars a month. Um, so you'll get that, but other than that, you know, that's pretty much it. We, we handle all the communication for you with Con Ed. OK. OK, because I just made my most recent payment I made it as of today, so I won't have to worry about. Correct, yes. So you will still. Right, so they might, you might get one more which is maybe like less than a month maybe if that I don't know, I don't know how coned bills cycle is, um, but as of **th if you've been connected, so it might be like a week or so that you probably will receive a smaller bill for that that week and change, um, that to complete the month of the month of March, um, but other than that, yeah, you should be good. OK, so I, I don't have to worry about contacting them and letting them know anything they like you said, you're already they're we're in contact with them. Nope. Correct. That is correct. OK, and um I was making a payment. The way I was making the payment was I had like they would have me on this balance billing uh arrangement. Mhm. Where I think they, you know, they had it so that all the payments through through the year wouldn't, wouldn't one wouldn't be more than another. They like have one to set one set amount. So would that have anything to do with what I still owe them, or they'll, they'll still figure that out the same way. Correct, so they would, yeah, they will, they was, I don't think you will owe them, um, that's something that they will send you a letter letting you know, um, the breakdown and they'll figure that out with the way, uh, because remember anything that your solar system is overproducing, they, you know, it sells back to them. So they will work that out with you if you owe anything at that point. OK. OK, OK, so at this point then right now I just, um, I just I don't have to worry about anything. I just, we're good to go. That's correct. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link which is for you to register for our mobile app and that mobile app you're able to see any billing statement or if you want to change your billing method, um, and also, um, you can submit referrals through there. Uh, right now we're running a promotion that it's if you refer somebody just for them setting the appointment with us, we give you $*** and then $** and if they do go solar, then we'll give you an extra $*** as well. Oh, OK. That's not good. OK. All righty. Not bad at all. So I'm gonna send you that, uh, just look out for my text. I'm gonna send you that link. Just register and then once you register, you could go to your app store and, and, uh, type in pothogen and then just download the pothogen app. OK. All righty. OK.

No, you can You can or you can just call this line we'll be more than able to help you, especially now that your system has been activated will probably be more helpful to you. OK, because I read the last thing was because um there was some things that he had told me, um, like with the tax abatement. Mhm. And another thing about, uh, you said I would receive a possible, uh, an incentive check. Oh, so yes, so that will be with him. So, so do check back with him then. Yeah, with that, yeah, yeah, anything that was promised, uh, before installation will be back to him. OK, OK. All right. All right, Mr. Wallace, you have a great day and look out for my text, OK?

So I'm, I'm not understanding exactly when it says company. Is that you guys? No, Egy. Oh, is that energy? That's energy. That's, that's the energy that you are buying from them. That's what I bought from them. OK, so net KWH was ****, it said. So, what are you guys paying for? I mean, what, what? Where it says customer KWH company, that's what the solar panels produce and you sold back to energy. If it's a negative. Man, it It's, it should, it says something, probably you're reading where it says previous meter reading, that's probably what's gonna show in negative. Well, they all showed was I'm looking at the um meter reading contract and the meter number and then it says rate N E RSA and it said total days is like ** and then current uh meter reading **** previous was ****. So I guess. Mhm. Then it says again, The readings and the contract and the card reading for *. I guess April *, April *rd, ****** and previous was **,***. That was for March. But I'm still trying to, I mean you think that the, the, this is what we're using, right? Mhm. Yes. This is, this is the electricity that we're using. And it's showing you. Mhm. That is correct. So what I'm trying to understand if we're using that much and then you're producing or, or we're pulling uh something from your company is. I'm trying to understand how it works, but I know it's, it would be cheaper. Let me see. Uh, Fuel, OK, fuel purchase **. OK. It said ele at the bottom it says in blue it says electric charges. It says energy charge $**.**. Then it says formula rate plan. And it has some percentages there, and then it says $**.**. And it says base rate adjustment rider minus *.*.**. Then it says purchase power cost recovery minus $**.**. And then it says fuel purchase power cost. Da da da and $**.** and then it says energy efficiency, EECR writer $*.**. So what is all this, all of this is saying what? I mean, I'm not understanding it. Hello. Oh, I was on mute. Can you hear me? I'm sorry, I was talking. Can you hear me? Hello. Yes, I hear you now. I didn't hear you at first. All right. So I, I'm, I'm sorry about that. So yeah, I was saying that you mentioned where it says energy charges, that's what you, that's your actual um electric bill. That's how much you um But from Entergy, what increase the electric bills every month, it's all the fees that Entergy is charging you for. So if you would like to know what are the adjustments that they, um, that he, that is on that bill, you need to contact them cause I'm not really sure. But fuel charges, those are the fees that they that they um charge the customer in order to provide electricity. Most of the time we don't control none of that is just energy. But your bill for that month was ** $** that you said. So, But ****. Yeah, that's your actual um bill. But what, what happened is that all the fees that electric company are charging, it may seem that it's more. So for better understanding, I will advise you to contact them and see what they said. What is that adjustment that it's on the bill. * charge. OK, adjustment and this is like, oh, OK, **** at, OK, it says **** at minus *.***% and then it says minus it's, it's uh ** cents. So that's the adjustment. I don't, it's only ** cents. Then it said purchase power costs. **. OK, I'll call MG then because it's showing that my electric bill is really low. It's $**. The electric charge is $** but when they add all the other, it brings it up to $*** a month. Let me see, and then there's an. Mhm. Exactly. Then there's some other charges. So look at um next to to the breakdowns, um, there's a section that says terms and conditions and definitions. I'm sorry, I don't know if you can see it. So it says fuel adjustment. It says cost of fuel needed to generate electricity and the cost of power purchased from other companies. And all this is related to. Yeah. I said Then it says um storm restoration benefits associated with the financing of storm. So yeah, those are fees that Ey are charging you. It's not us. So it's yeah, that's what they told me last time, yeah, OK. OK, uh, I just have to call them and talk to them about all these different choices I got. OK, alright, thank you, thank you. No, you're welcome. You're welcome. I will notate the information here on your account and yeah, everything is working perfectly, OK? OK. OK, thank you. Bye-bye. You're welcome, ma'am.

Let me see how the system is working. You still there? Yeah, I'm here. I'm checking your system right now. It, it produced a let me see, yeah, it went down the production by November, December and January, but it's typically normal by winter time. On December it started to pick it up. OK. And March is working, yeah, producing. For. Uh, the system is working fine here on our side. So, Are you using Uh, more appliances, they incorporate like elec an electric car. No. Hell no. I don't even drive. No. Oh, OK. OK. Do you, do you check with your electricity provider if they raise your your bill for some reason if they Um If you have a new tariff. Look, I'm, I'm, like I said, I'm talking with them now. I'm arguing with them now about I didn't receive no bills until the end of March, the beginning of April. Mhm. Oh Now they're saying I owe them $***. I don't owe them $***. It was not my fault if y'all didn't bill me from June until now. Now I know my kids should have been cut in half. Yeah, we don't Yeah, we, uh, we, we don't handle uh the bills from, from your electricity providers, so. I know you don't. That's why I'm arguing with them. OK, we, yeah, unfortunately, we don't have any, any type of information from them. But nobody can tell me how much. Um, How much electricity are these solar panels producing? I can tell you now, let me see. Uh, by February, the system produced *.** kilowatts. Uh. Oh *.** by February. *.** January. *.** December. *.*. On, on November *** by October. Oh. **, that's that's ****. *.** September, *.** August, *.** July. And the system was activated by June *, ****. Mhm. Anyway, anyway, if there is something wrong, uh, Ms. Middlebrooks, if there is some, if you're not saving what you, you have stipulated. Mhm Uh, on your contract, uh, by the ** months because we normally calculate your production in the * seasons. It has to be ** months. Uh, by June ****, you experiences uh high bills, electricity high bills. We conduct an analysis on your, on your system, and if you didn't produce what you're supposed to be producing, you will have a credit for that. Right. Uh Mhm. OK. But, but it is it's working. We need to see by June **** if you still have those high bills and we do the mathematics, we do, we can do the mathematics for you by the by the ** months and if we determinate that your system didn't produce what you expected, that is guarantee on your contract, you will get a credit for that. Mhm. We will compensate, sir, for that. So. OK. Uh, you, you, you will see some, some month. The They are different to other ones, especially in winter time it was when the system produces less energy that's typically normal. So by in the ** months if we, we do the mathematics for you and you didn't generate the savings that are, are stipulated on your contract, you, you will get a compensation on our side. Right. Mhm. That that's, that's guaranteed by. OK. Mhm. But like I said, y'all better, uh, y'all better checking that because if y'all giving tax rebates to people in New York, you should be giving tax rebates to people in Philadelphia too. Oh Mhm. Cause we're not that far apart. It's not like it's across the country. OK. Or down south. You understand what I'm saying? It takes me an hour from where I live to go to New York.

Our our our our billing department because I'm not seeing them why they're. I, I, I see, uh, uh, you know, an upgrade case for you, but I'm not sure why they're still texting you about the other one. It does show that there's still a balance due on it. It Oh, OK, let me just explain the balance of thing. It was only by word of mouth, and I'm so sorry I didn't get it in writing. Yes, ma'am. OK, all I, all I owe was *** and something dollars, OK? Mhm. My previous channel. Mhm. Which is my fault. I should have not changed it, but just talking about being an upgrade to be better panels da da da. I did it. Mhm. Yes. But before I change this over. Uh-huh. That man called, the salesperson called about * different people to see about this balance. He said, you don't have to pay that because the contract was between Adam and them, and Adam no longer exists. Mhm. So therefore that I didn't have to pay it. That's what they say. Uh, they said I have to pay it. I never would proceeded with this process of getting the new panels and extending me for ** more years. I had * more months to pay or * more funds to pay, which I should in my mind I should not have. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Change that should definitely long we just paid it out. So far, they have taken these panels that they want me to pay for. Well, I could pay for those panels if they want this balance just to bring me back the panels. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Cause they was on their minds. Uh, no, ma'am, they, they. That's, that's we can start with this. Yeah, um, the, the, the, there were a lease before and just when the lease is over, yeah, yeah. They, they, they want, what happens when the lease is over? Yeah. Well, you have an option, yeah, no, no, we have a couple of options you can either renew the lease, you can upgrade the system, um, or you can um just turn them in. They become yours? No. When we got, we got this, when we got these panels, wait a minute, let me, let me go back. I have several people that bought the panels the same time we did that we were, you know, when we got ours, they, they also verify. I told them I remember and be purchasing that panels. They say the same thing we purchased them because the state paid up so much money and we had to order **,*** left. It was not a lease. It was gonna be paid up in those ** years. That's my understanding of it. That's the understanding of it. I wish I could find paperwork on it, but I can't. Or you could purchase them. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Anyway, nobody offered me to do a new lease or nothing like that. My $*** have been paid for and I've been done, and I'm so sorry because they paid this and they're done. And nobody asking for no more money, no nothing for no lease or we lose it or whatever it's done. So now I'm sitting in this situation. I got these other panels sitting on my house and they're still asking me money for panels that they took away from me. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. I, I don't, I don't get it. Before we did this decision, I, like I said, they said I didn't need to pay it. I know if I have to pay it, I would not have done going forward with what I've done with. Now I'm just trying to get this thing thing. They come not gonna turn this off. So what they turn off my new panels or what? I don't wanna follow. I, I don't understand. Well Mhm. I, I, I Yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the disconnection is actually for the old system, which doesn't make any sense since they've already, you're already going down to an end, yeah. Exactly. They don't, they're not here. Yeah, and that's that I, I think that's uh so um I'm gonna reach out to the uh to the billing team uh and and get them to, to try and figure this out and, and, and reach out to you uh with an explanation because I, I can't quite figure it out myself as to why, as to why they. Exactly. OK, let me, right, and OK, let me say all that. I'm gonna say all this about * weeks ago they sent a man to the house. So, Mhm. Mhm. I'm telling him about disconnecting the stuff then, OK? And I explained him the same situation. So he didn't touch me, he tried to call somebody because he didn't get in touch with nobody. So he said, go get back with me and after you figure it out, well. Mhm. He has to I've been calling his number and it's been miss never answered and the mailbox is full. So therefore this time I said let me just get back with this and talking about disconnect the game. Mhm. Mhm. What are they doing? They're gonna cut, so he wouldn't they came to the house, I would say OK they weren't gonna disconnect. So he came to the house. So that, that makes me think, OK, you come to disconnect my unit. Yes ma'am. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I No, I just feel like I'm in a hard rocket, a place that, you know, where, where do I go with this. Uh Yeah, I understand. I do understand what you're saying. Yeah, so, um, let me, let, let me, like I said, I got. Yeah, I Yes, and I'm, I'm just, so I blame myself for. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I said, Yeah, I'm the same I know you said you said you just. Go ahead. Mhm. Well, the thing is is that it, that uh it seems that the uh original one that, that we're talking about was uh was uh was for Adam and this and the renewal is actually the, the, the upgrade is going is going into your name I would assume, right? Um and so, um. it, it did. Yeah, um, so what I guess, uh, are, are, uh, Our, our billing team needs to understand is that the, the one for Adam. Is over with and this one is replacing it so um and the and whatever that balance was somebody told you that it's not, it's not due and I I've got to get them to figure out what's gotta be done there um because you know this. Right, but Well, yeah, but see they told the guy that was the sales person that came, he called * or * different people what to do in this situation, and they said I should not be responsible for that because of the contract was between Adam and Posit. So I'm not being I should be responsible for that, but evidently somebody along the line up here said I should be responsible for it. I don't know. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it too that I don't keep getting these messages and and people coming to the house to turn it off and all this kind of stuff. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Mhm. Yes ma'am, I understand. I don't know exactly how you turn it off, how you turn. Can I ask you a question though? How did they do, how do they do disconnected? By, by the computer or they come to the house and disconnect? Well, sure. It depends on the type of system you have um as to how that how that's actually done. Some systems do require that they come out and physically turn it off. Most of them are, you can do it over the internet to the uh the communication that we have with it over the cell modem. Oh well, OK, well if he came out forever then I must be having these older system that he has to come out and disconnect, which I thought I would get a more of an upgrade system than that. Well, the one that you're the one that you're purchasing is an upgraded system and I don't know that that one, that one would be remote. Um, the original system that was on there, uh, I'm understanding that that one's already been taken off. Is that correct? Yes, yes, take us all the way. We have. OK, that's that's what I thought so they can't, they can't disconnect, they can't disconnect that system, the new system, because the old system is not there. The old system is the one that they're quote unquote disconnecting, but it's already been removed. So, um, and I guess that's what they need to our our billing system is not, is not getting it right, so. No, it's not. Yeah, but this, it's some kind of way that Right, the go ahead, the. Right, right. Somebody's not getting it right. Yes, ma'am. So OK, now what's your name again? You said you don't call me back and let me know um. I'm gonna have somebody from the billing team reach out to you and, and figure this out because I'm actually, I'm actually part of the installation team and you got routed to us because of the, the new system that they're installing, um, our team handles handles handles that side of it. We would update you if there's any delays or something like that. So I need to OK, OK. Oh, Mhm. Um, I'm part of that team, so I don't usually handle this stuff, but I, I did work in the customer care department beforehand, so I understand how it works. Um, but I've just got to reach out to them and let them, uh, try and figure out what's going on here. Um, and so, uh, I, I'll, I'll, I'll send them a message, uh, that the, the system, the, the, the old system has already been removed and a new system is being, an upgraded system is being installed. And that you were, you were told originally. It's already, it's already installed. Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am. Uh. Excuse me, it's already, it's already installed. Yes ma'am, I understand that. I, I, I understand that. Um, I, I guess our, our, our, our, our, our, our, uh our collections billing department, they don't know that they're not, they're not seeing, they see the old system because it's, it's the one that's active, they don't see the new one because it's not, not finished, we haven't finished the installation process to activate it yet, so they can't see that yet. Um, and that's what the, that's probably where the that's where the problem is with them. They see the one that was uh. OK. Wait. It's The older one, so. OK, another question. You say I'm not activated yet? No, I don't think so. Uh, let me double check. We're still waiting on the Let's see, I believe we still are waiting for. Uh, your inspections have passed. We're waiting on the utility company to give us approval, I believe, is what we're on, is where we're at with yours. Oh Yes ma'am, so give me just a second. I'll double check that and make sure, yeah, that's what, that's that's what we're going. It's uh oh it's waiting on Egy to basically uh finish up, um, so. Really You know that that's where it's at. Now do you have to come. So you have to come out? Um, probably, probably not since you had a solar panel system there before. They probably don't have to come out physically to the house. Um, it's just a matter of, uh, updating their, their records with the new system from the old system, um, and then setting it up in their, in their. OK, so you can OK, another question. When you get that pass sticker that don't mean instead of unit zone because the unit is um activated. No, that just means that it's passed it's it's. Even though they turned it on. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's in standby mode right now. Um, so we can do it that's one. Oh, even though it show on, even though it shows on in the media, they're still on standby. Yeah, it's a. Yeah, it's on standby until they give us permission to activate it, it'll sit there and and and it'll show that the system is on. Thank you. But it's not producing yet until uh Ey tells us we can turn it on. Well, sorry, I'm making so glad for telling me that because the man that came out to turn it off, he told me my system was on it was, it was already working. Oh. Mhm. Yeah, he can see that he, he can see that, well, he doesn't, he's not, he's not in it on the installation side. He can look at them and tell it's, it's on, it is physically on, it's, but it's not producing, so, um, so that's where, that's where you're at so. And it's not Right. Right. Right. Right. That So, uh, what I'll do is I'll get the, uh, like I have said, I'll get the, uh, the, uh. Well? For the old system, the, the, I, I'll get in touch with the, the billing, uh, department here and see if we can get them to to straighten this out for you and then reach out to you and and and then we'll see if we can get us the text message to stop, OK? Uh, because they can't disconnect the system that's not there. Please. Yeah. What? Are you, are you? So. Exactly, but then the main character I said when it came out, it, it was kind of like make me OK. But since he came out, I said, what do you do you're going, you know. But I thank you so much for your information because you cleared up some questions that um. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. That would not answer was wrong information, let's put it that way. Yeah, and it He told me I was already connected. Yeah, uh, well, I guess it's a, it's a, it's a, a misunderstanding more than anything, um, you know, uh, the, the team, uh, the guy that comes out there is from the billing team. He's used to dealing with systems that are already installed and, and, and physically out there. He can look at them and tell if they're on or not and functioning, you know, but uh. That's what he did. He showed me that I look at the button. Yeah, yep, it is on, it is on, but it's not, it's not functioning. Um, it's, it's what it's, it's like I said, it's what we call a standby mode. Um, it's, it'll show that it's on, but it's not producing anything, uh, you know, because we can't, we can't do that until, you know, the utility company says we, we have permission, you know, um, and that's, that's, that, that's what we're waiting on for to activate that for you. Uh, we'll get that uh here probably pretty soon. Oh Um, from Entergy, it's just, uh, Entergy and is, uh, has been notoriously slow, to be honest with you, it's uh we're just waiting on them, um, but once we got that permission from them, um, they'll they'll activate it and we'll give you a call uh once it is activated, go over the entire thing with you and let you know how the system works and and all that stuff, OK? Mm Mm Alright, I thank you, I appreciate that. All right. Not a problem, not a problem. All right, any other things I can do for you? No, you answered all the questions I need to ask except one. I don't know if you'll be able to answer it. What happens if you, uh, what happens if you was to sell a house and whatever your units lease? What do you do? Uh Ask away I. Oh, well, that's real simple. Um, the, the lease can transfer to the new owners, um, if in say * years from now, * years or whenever you, you do, if you decide to sell the home, um, you, you would tell the people you disclose it as part of the listing that there is a lease for the system, um, and the new owners can assume the lease at the same point for the same price that you've got it at. Um, you know, and they just basically you've got a ** year lease on, on the system. Um, and they would pick up from whatever point that is, uh, at the same price. So all we would do is we would, we would redo the contracts for them, have them sign new contracts, but they would essentially take over right where you live, leave it off at, um, doesn't cost you anything, doesn't cost them anything. Mhm. OK. So now if for some reason they don't want it, then, then, then there's a little then there might be a problem, you know, then we have to figure out uh uh if they, if they don't want it, uh, the removal of the system and all that stuff, but usually speaking, most people want them. OK. You know, you know, particularly if it's an upgraded system like you're getting right now, um, so, OK. Right, right. OK. Well, thank you. You are quite welcome there. You've been very helpful. Well, I appreciate, I appreciate you say that. Uh, if you have any other questions, uh, please just give us a call, OK? OK, thank you. Thank you. You have a good afternoon. Bye. Bye bye. You too.

We're about to close on April **th. April **th? OK, got it. Alrighty Miss Cynthia, so what we, our process is, is that we, you know, of course get in contact with the buyer whether it's you call us or we call you all, um, and we go over the account in full detail with you, um, so we go over everything so that we could be on the same page, um, and I'm gonna answer any questions that you might have and then we're gonna move on to the customer, um, questionnaire which it only takes about * minutes and it's just us collecting information on you that we don't have, OK? OK. Alrighty, so first I'll just start by going over the solar. Um, our solar was put on the home to help lower the cost of your electric bill monthly, right? So it doesn't act as a battery backup or anything like that. And what I mean by that is if your home were to lose power for some reason, um, whether it's bad weather or blackout, anything like that, the solar will not kick on to power your home, so it doesn't have a battery which attached to it, which acts as a generator to store some of those kilowatt hours. Um, in case you know of a blackout or if your home was to lose power, OK, um, so it's just strictly just to save on your electric bill monthly, right? So this lease here is a ** year lease, um, the current homeowner now has gotten the lease down to *** payments remaining from the original *** months, so *** months equals ** years, and he's gotten the account all the way down to ***. Mhm. So you'll be picking up um at the *** going forward, OK? Um, the account is due on the **th of each month. You do have a ** day grace period if you ever need one, you will have the option to sign up for auto pay if you would like. If you decline auto pay, that's no problem. You can always give us a call to make a payment to pull, to pull the payment or go online, OK? OK perfect.

I Yes, yes, so you left a few voicemail you left a few voicemails for both the, the new buyers and um and their agent and they haven't responded back, is that right? OK, um, I just spoke to the agent, so we're closing May *nd on that house. They, they haven't taken over yet, but, but everything is worked out. We've already. Mr. Randy. Correct. Yes, yes, sir. OK. OK. You know, did everything they did inspections, the whole shebang, so it is happening. Can you do me a favor? I did reach out to his agent. I did speak to him and I told him that, hey, I just got a voicemail and he haven't responded back and so forth and so on. But is there any way, um, you can email me the form or forms that that they need to be signed? They may sign. OK. Um Mhm. Before May *nd, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna be at the closing and I'm gonna give them to the title company as well. So they're not gonna be able to close on the house until they sign these forms, and I want to have them in my possession that way. I, I make sure that they get it signed, not that they're trying, not that they're trying not to sign it, but this is one of those things I can see slipping through the cracks unless I, unless I stay on top of it. So I'm really glad you called, um, can you? Mhm. Yeah. Right, I understand. So unfortunately I cannot send you a copy of the lease assumption, but you can request them from the buyers if they are willing to forward that email over to you, but unfortunately we're not able to send that to you. It would have to be the buyers. That's OK. You, you, you mean from my, uh, from my sellers, you mean can my sellers, the owners of the house now? OK. Yes, so, so no, so the buyers of the home now we sent them the lease assumption so that they can go ahead and assume the solar panels, right, and have the lease transferred into their name. So we went ahead and sent them the documents we did the application, so we've spoken to the buyers already, but now we need a signature and they haven't signed the lease assumption to have it, you know, transferred into their name. I see. Mhm. I see. Um. And so you can't, you can't send me a copy of that, huh? Um, let me ask you this. I'm representing the sellers who currently own the house. They gotta sign that as well. I would, I would think, right? Right. Mhm. So they do not they remain respons since they already have a lease assumption and the account with us, um, currently open. They're still responsible for the account and the payments until that buyer, you know, signs over and y'all close. So even if you don't you do you guys do close on the *nd of May, if they still have not signed, your seller will still be responsible for the payments in the agreement. Oh no. OK. Got you, got you, got you. OK, so they don't have to sign anything. The seller, the current owners don't have to sign anything in relation to the account. Right. Right, they do not have to sign anything we're just uh we're just transferring their current agreements to the buyers. Got you, got you. OK, alright, I'm just gonna to put on my calendar then, um, to make sure because I was gonna make sure I got. Yes, sir, because they will still be responsible for that agreement and the payments until they sign. I got you. Let me ask you, just out of curiosity. Like, what's the, like, why can't you send it to me to make so I mean I'm, I'm the one who's gonna make sure it gets signed, not that they would, they may sign it before then, but they're not gonna go buy the house until they sign it, and I'm gonna be the one to make sure that. So like what I look like is our confidence. Yeah, so that's just policy. It's sent through DocuSign so we have to send it to the buyers for them to sign electronically. So there is no copy yet until they finish signing then we'll have a copy of it, um, and then at that point we'll go ahead and send the buyers a copy of that lease assumption and if they want to send it to you then that's fine, but unfortunately we can't go ahead and send you the lease assumption when it's for them to sign. Got you. Yeah, we know, I got you I got you, um. Right Um, just thinking out loud, um, what I mean, I'm trying to make sure because not that the buyers are trying to get out and not signing it, but if I got, if I'm able to hold over, hey, hey, you can't buy this house until you do sign it, then we know for sure that they they're gonna sign it. But so they're not gonna if if if they are trying to not sign it, they're not gonna give, you know what I mean, they're not gonna give me anything. So, um, but I'm just trying to figure out, yes, I use DocuSign too, but so I mean it's just a document that you upload a PDF you upload the DocuSign. Mhm. Right. Right. Like, why wouldn't y'all be able to give me a copy of that? Like, like, I don't, that's like there's so confidentiality like, like what's the, what's the Right, and like I stated, unfortunately that's just our policy we cannot grant you a copy. Hm. OK Yeah, but I was just calling to see if you have heard from them or if you can tell them to go ahead and check their email um but otherwise and that's all that we would need just their signature. Uh What did you, how, how long ago did y'all send those, uh, how long ago did y'all send the, uh, the DocuSign to them? We sent it last month on the twenty-eighth. OK, and y'all, is there any way you can maybe do that remind you know you can hit remind and I'll send it again like today. Can you do that because I'm, I'm, I'm gonna call. Yep, and we have also spoken to them and they said that they'll go ahead and check their email but still nothing so I did go ahead and resend it to them so that it'll be at the top of their inbox but we still have not heard back. OK, perfect. OK, yeah, so, so you when when did you resend it again today or? Yes, sir. OK, alright, perfect. Well, let me call the agent and let him know that, and uh I appreciate you calling. Stay in touch with me if you don't mind. Call me because I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make sure it happens. So, so, and if you don't mind, if you, when you do get it, so I quit hounding them, if you could please reach out to me, hey, Randy, we got it in that way, um. Yeah, no problem. OK, no problem. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, yeah, um, let me ask you this, and I guess so even after they after they signed it, we still can't get it, we still can't get an executed copy of it saying that it, it that that it's signed, right? I still have to get that from them. I can't get that from you. All right. No, so there will be an executed copy and then if they can provide that to you then that's fine, but unfortunately we can't go ahead and send it to somebody else. It would be for them to send it over to you. Got you. And the seller and, and the current owner doesn't have to sign anything and they can't get a copy of it at all. Cause, cause what it seems weird that, that, that y'all would let the let the, the new people assume everything, you know what I mean? Like, what if the what if the current people Didn't want to let them assume it. You seem to do you need authorization from them, no. From who? From the current, from the, from the current owners of the house. Well, we already did because he initially started this process saying that he was gonna sell his home and that he needed to transfer to the new buyers, so he already gave us authorization to start the lease transfer so they don't need to sign anything. They already have an agreement with us. They just want it transferred to the new buyers. I got you. So y'all just take Right, right, she'll just take that thing verbally, OK. Alright, I appreciate the info. Yeah, please let me know once they sign out. Thank you. I No problem you have a great day. Hey, wait, let me one last question for you. What if, if the sellers wanna make sure that, hey, we wanna make sure that they, that they sign, are the sellers able to get a copy of that or no, nobody can get a copy of it except for the, for the, for the buyers. If they can call to say that they do want a copy of the lease assumption, then yes we can. OK, just, you know, because they're gonna feel better knowing they got something to write saying, hey, you know, knowing that it's officially done. I don't necessarily need it.

OK, well, I, I actually. OK, well, I actually do have a question for you. Um, so the, the process is, has been really moving along pretty good, um, you guys do a great job keeping you informed by email and, and, you know, you know, through the app, um, so I want to ask you, um, they came out, they did the roof, and I see that the permits and stuff have been accepted for work by Pico. Yep. Um, the only thing that he said that somebody was gonna come out and then make sure that the house was um like sealed up and weatherization whatever money was left. I Yeah, that, that. So, um, I just was, uh, I was wondering where we at with that process. Um, well, I don't see anything here at the moment. I'd, I'd have to reach out to the energy efficiency team there and, uh, get an update on an install date for like when they plan on sending the, the technicians out to the home, um, but we could definitely get you an update there, um, sometime within the next ** hours. Yeah. Yeah OK. OK, yeah, cause that's, they told me I could reach out to them, but I, I, you know, I was just waiting to hear from them, you know, depending on their schedule and I'm due to have surgery tomorrow. OK. So I won't be walking around. I'll be not weight bearing for * weeks. But that that that won't stop anything that has to go on, you know, here, if they need to come in, you know, my mom and my wife are both here, so. Oh Right. Right. Got it, got it, got it. So, um, Yeah. I'm just um OK Just trying to see, so if you could, you know, if you could let me know about that where they are in the process because they do they have to come in before the panels go on? Um, no, they don't have to come in before the panels go on. No, that doesn't. Oh, OK. Yeah, no, they could kind of come whenever they whenever during the process, yeah. OK. OK, OK, because the, um, the gentleman, he, he, you know, when he came out and told me about the whole spill, he was like the roofers they'll come making sure the electricity and the roof is OK. Then the other guys will come in and they'll do like uh to see if the house is sealed up and um you know they do their thing and then the last thing would be that they will come. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. And install the panels and um wait for Pico to come in and change the meter at the end. Yeah Yeah, that, that process is, is usually how it goes with the, with the meter swap at the end, um, but yeah, the energy efficiency checks come whenever it, it doesn't, uh, it doesn't mess with the with the system or the process there. OK. Oh, OK, so they could come in literally if the panels were installed, they can come in afterwards and still do their thing. Yes. OK, OK, well that's good to know. Yeah. Yep yep. OK. So yeah, they're just gonna check for any like any like uh um cracks or leaks in the house, you know, just making sure that uh you're getting the best uh out of out of your out of your system so it's not using as much energy. um you know a lot of people don't realize how much energy they're using without, you know, without knowing that there's cracks or holes in in their windowsills or the doorway, anything like that, even the attic. So they try to, if they try to secure that, that would just like help a lot more with uh your. OK. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Your solar uh production and also the utility cost. OK Right, right, OK, OK, and this, OK, so this, this number you called me on, is it a contact number for you or are you gonna email me a number? Yep. Yeah this is my contact number here um but I'll definitely send you an email as well. OK. OK, that'd be awesome. Yeah, that'd be awesome so any question I can reach out to you. OK. Yes sir.

047e62db-cee4-4185-9687-536e7029122d,"Thank you for calling Positing. This is Lukeha on a recorded line. How can I help you? Hi, uh, good afternoon. I, um, I'm a current customer and I have two accounts because there are like * solar leases on my roof, um, which I, I recently took over after purchasing, um, a house, and I'm, I'm looking at the billing, um. Mhm. Mhm. Or the the the bills for the for this month and for last month and um I wanted to make sure I understood the amount like the monthly amount due for each lease correctly. I I was wondering if you could help me with that. Mhm. OK. OK, that, no problem. And who am I speaking with? Uh, my name's Francis Fleischer. OK, and Mr. Fleischer, what's the address listed on your account? [REDACTED]. OK. Awesome. Um, zip code is *****. OK. Thank you so much for verifying that information for me, Mr. Fleischer. Um, and so your main concern is that you just took over this lease. You're looking at the bills and you just want to clarify how much each account is, correct? Yes. Awesome. OK. So I've got the first one pulled up here for you and if you'd like to write down this account number, it's the ***. ***-***. OK, I have that up right now too on the payment uh page. OK. Awesome. And so that. So I have it set up with autopay. Uh, you do, I do see that there. And so normally it looks like previously you were paying $**.** a month, but I wanna check to see if there's an escalator because I do see that coming in May it's gonna be $**.** so I just wanna look at the um service contract if that's OK. Just give me one second. Mhm. Oh yeah sure thing. And that is normal. Sometimes we have, um, Sometimes we have accounts where they have like an where they go up like $* each day I'm sorry, not each day each year, so I just wanna see if that's the case with this one. Let's see. Each year, yeah. I think it is. OK. And. Let me just pull it up here. To the payment schedule. And yes, sir, that is exactly the case there. So, April was the last payment for $**.**. And so beginning May **** all the way through, um, April ****, the payments are gonna be $**.** each month on this account, OK? And now let me find the OK and now let me find the other one here for you, but it's the same address, the **. OK, I understood. West *th Street. All right. And so this one we're gonna call. I don't think that so that last one that we did, you wanna call that one system *, OK? And so now on system *. OK. That account number is gonna be *********. OK? OK. And so that one it looks like is on a promotion actually. And let me check it out. OK, yeah, that's really why I was calling because I, they look so different, the two prices. OK. Yeah. Yes, sir. So on that one looks like there is an eight month promotion on that account that began February ****, and it's ********. So for through September ****, you will only be paying $* a month for that account, OK? Beginning October ****, the payments are going to begin at $**.**. OK. And Got it. OK. I do not see where that account has an escalator, so that one will never change. It will be $**.** each month, OK? Oh, that's great and that's for like ** years or something? Mhm. So it expires on January *st, **,***,*** is when it expires, yes, sir. Got it. OK. OK, so there's no escalator on that one. No, sir. And that OK, what, what was the, uh, just curious, was the promotion something when the, the former owner like signed the contract that they got the first year or something for like $* a month? Mhm. Well, it is something that we generally do for um our customers whenever they open up the account. So I said the other one was labeled a system um *. Which is really weird because I would have expected the promotion to be on the other one instead of this one, but for whatever reason it's on this one and it does look like that first payment was made in February, so that makes sense. So maybe the other one was actually. OK. Mm. Yeah, maybe the other one is actually system one, yeah, maybe the other is actually system * and that this one is system * that would make more sense. Maybe in February of Wait, the OK. Sorry, but when was the first payment, February of this year or February of last year? February of this year, ****. Really? Yeah. That's we were in the when was the contract signed for the for the system for for this other system. Let me check here. I will say this though, contracts are signed way in advance, so that's not unusual. Let me go back. I'm going to the actual contract here to see. When it was signed. Uh, fine. It was actually signed. July of **** is when it was signed. Oh, but it was just it was installed in **** I guess and then. Yeah, it's probably so July **** is when it was actually signed and then let's see when it was actually activated. Let's see. I'm going through everything here. Yeah, it started being activated late September **** and then it was actually activated February of ****. That was a process, yeah. Oh, and they must have gotten the first year like for free then and then it became $* a month in February of this year and then. Yeah, not so, um, it was activated in February of ****, I mean **, it was verified as operational, um, in October of ****. So that was all us, right? So we have to verify it as operational before we ever start billing you and then we do need to contact the customer and make sure they understand all the terms of everything again before we start billing so. Um Got it. If it took a while to get in contact with them because we wouldn't have started billing to a minimum of ** days after we were able to make sure they understood all the terms and everything, yeah. Oh, I, I, OK. Yeah. So it was just a long process for them. I see, I see what you're saying. So I got on boarded I guess in February of this year when um when we when we closed on the house, um. Mhm. Mhm. Is there um. I I think there's like dashboards and stuff where I can see how the systems are performing and how much electricity they're producing, but I wouldn't get access. I remember at the time being told like I wouldn't get access right away um do you, do you know if those would be ready yet or? Right. Yeah, I can do that. I can get you access to that. Um, if that might take some more time. No, I can, it's just me sending you over a link here now, OK, so I will say that your, um, the email address that I have on file for you is Fleischer.Dan@gmail.com. Is that still a good email address? Uh, yes, it is. OK, so the username for which account? Well, no, I'm gonna do this the. Username for your account is gonna be your full email.**. OK? So it's the email address do your street number. And I've just sent you over that link and then you can just follow the prompts from there. OK. ** at the end of the email you said? Mhm. Is it uh sorry, is it ** or just **? **. At the end, **. OK, got it. uh, I got the email. Mhm. OK. So Yeah. Yeah, OK. Yeah, thank you so much. Oh, you're very welcome. So just a quick recap, we've gone over how much your billing is for each one, gone over the promotion for the second account as well, and also got you access to the customer portal. We did answer some questions about the install of the second system as well. Is there anything else that you need assistance with right now, Mr. Fleischer? Um, not at this time, thank you. OK. You're very welcome. Thank you so much for your time and you have a great rest of the day, OK? Thanks you too. All right. Bye-bye. All right bye bye.","Customer called to clarify billing amounts for two solar lease accounts recently acquired after a home purchase.

60c288b2-8a20-4337-b355-0f99ccf70096,"Hello. Hey, Ms. Renata. How you doing? I'm OK. I'm trying to get my sinuses together. I've been battling for my knife. Uh, hold on. What you got my baby, mhm. Hold on, hold on. Let me do my whole spill. This is Anna from Passage and on a recorded line. Um, uh, my supervisor, she did go over the bills. She was calling you to explain it better than I can, and I don't want to talk to you with her. Let me see if I can pull up the bills first. OK. Mhm. Mm. ** And this is your account at [REDACTED]. Mhm. All right. So, Um. I'm looking for these bills. I just had it pulled up. There we go. So this one has the amount on there. No, that's the one on the. So the last bill I got was for the one due in March. So based on the bill, from what I see, the usage is really high. Yeah. So that, I know for sure she was gonna go over that because, all right. When it says company KWH to customer, that's how much your usage is, right? I don't know if you have a bill in front of you. Mhm. So your, your usage was, it's just an example. Let's just say let's go by the one from March that you sent me recently. So the company um company KWH customer. Mm mm. For I Your usage, yeah, the company can be customers your usage. So your usage is at *,***. That's pretty high actually. And then the sell back meaning what's left over from after utilizing the panels will be the customer of the company. OK OK. So your cell bank is ***. And I even checked to make sure that she wasn't on, you know, levelized billing because that plays a part in it too. But based upon the bill, like, so if you at work right now, is anyone at the house right now? Mm. My mom is there. Your mom, OK. Now, does, does she do more things? Only person. Only person that stay with me is me and my mama. Uh, my mama is disabled. She can't do anything. Yeah, I do So do you do mostly everything at the night, at night, you know, at night instead of the daytime? Yeah, when I get off. I don't really do nothing in the daytime cause I'm not there in the daytime. That. Right. So that explains it too, because Basically, the panels, they basically save more. You gotta do everything throughout the daytime, while, you know, especially sunny days, because that way you can utilize the energy from your panels versus the, the energy from actual energy. So, when you go home at night, there's not that much sunshine, and you're basically using the, you know, the power grid from energy. So that's probably why you feel like you're not saving because you're not, you know, you're not home throughout the daytime to really do much because you can't use your panels. So, Yeah. What I can do based upon the bill. And based upon your monthly savings. So you normally would say **. I can see. If I could get you a write down. So instead of paying **, I'm seeing that I could lower your bill. I can't promise anything. I have to go with my supervisor. So instead of $** a month to $** a month. Do you think You'll be able to afford that. All right, that's better. That's better. I think the main issue right now is because, like I said, you're working throughout the daytime, so you're not being, you don't get the chance to really utilize your pants unless you're off on the weekends, right? Or you're Mhm. So that's probably when you'll be able to really use the panels. So, moving forward, don't do too much at night, like washing clothes and everything, don't do that. Do it throughout the daytime when you can or the days you're off on the weekend. Sunny days are your best days. Reason being is because the solar panels get their power and they produce electricity from the sun. Yep. Yeah. That way you're on the grid from the solar panels and not the actual utility company that you, that you're with. Oy. Now, Ey, you know how they are. They can be iffy sometimes, sometimes they just We don't know why they're so high one day and then so low the next. That's, I don't know this entity. But I've also noticed too, winter time is gonna be the most crucial time. Reason being it's more cloudy days, it's colder days. The heater definitely jumps up your bill. Now that summer and, well, spring, should I say summer are approaching, more sunny days. We'll do everything throughout the daytime when it's sunny, but that way you're utilizing the panels and not the actual utility company, OK? Yes. Unplug unnecessary items and also when you're not home. Alright baby. Whether it's a heater or AC. If you're not home, you're gonna put the AC on, put it on ** and up. If you're gonna have That's why I have it there right now. Yeah, or they recommend really **, to be honest. I know it sounds crazy, but if you're not home. They do cause that's hot. Right, but listen, when you're not home, cause I, I'm, I'm doing this myself. I'm learning. When I put it, put it up at ** and I'm not home and I get home, it's still cool. It's gonna generate better because, you know, you're not there. So, but in the, in the wintertime though, that's, I've noticed the heater is definitely the, the one that's gonna get your bill high. So in the winter time, moving forward, when you're not home, but I know your mom's home. Don't put the heater too high. I know it's easier said than done. But that heater, if you put anything above like over **, it's gonna run your bill high, I'm telling you. It's best to do between ** to ** at the highest. I know it's crazy, but that's, you know, to save your money at least. I'm sorry. And unplug anything unnecessary like essential cords or charges. Just try doing it that way and this weekend. Like start doing your chores. Just try this weekend. Just, you know, getting in the rhythm of it. Try doing everything throughout the daytime, early, like, you know, when it's sunny. Get it out the way and then go from there. Um, I'm gonna talk to my supervisor. All right sweetheart. Yeah In regards to, you know, what I just told you about the write down because it had at least help you out and see a difference in your savings. OK. Alright, let me know. I will. I will give you a call back, OK? Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Renata. No problem.","Customer called regarding high energy bill.
