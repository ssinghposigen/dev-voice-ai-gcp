Um I'm sorry, my name is Tania Stevens. What is your name again? I'm sorry. My name is Joanne. Joanne, hi Joanne. I'm a positive customer and um. I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels uh trying to get an answer to this question and hopefully you can answer me now, even though my utility company here on the east coast where I'm located has closed for, for business for the day. Sure. OK. Um, It, it, and I don't, I don't understand how come I can't pull up the email that I got from you guys. It was either an email. I'm hoping it wasn't a text message because I delete them. I get so many, but nonetheless, I received notification either via text or email from Positgen, um, but if it was from. Have it unfortunately I can't pull it up. It was either late February or during the month of March. I received notification telling me that as an incentive, uh, I am, um, going to receive $*** I, I can't give it to you verbatim because I can't remember but it was for a $*** incentive for having the panels installed blah blah blah. So depositgen said we're gonna do what we have to do on our end, but you have to reach out to your um electrical supplier because it's a form that they have to supply to me, the customer, to complete in order to complete the process. I was like, cool. So I called to confirm. OK. Uh, the validity of the of the message, the person on it, they said yes, Ms. Stevens, that's, that's accurate, but um, you have to reach out to your provider. I think that's, that's fine. That's what I'm calling to confirm, which they did, and I reached out to Pico here in Philadelphia. They said yes, there's a form you have to fill the form out. So I called that that they said we can send it to you through the mail, US postal or we can email. Um, I don't trust the mail too much, so I asked them, could they send it to my, I asked them, could they email it to me and um I just don't remember what the subject line was, but if I type solar, solar, that should come up, that should bring the email up, but it's not from Pico and I had spoken with about ** different, ** different offices at Pico this evening and even if they had the word solar. Right. OK. In their name. It, they, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about. No disrespect. So, I'm calling. Oh, it's OK. I understand. I'm calling you guys, my solar company to see if in fact, you, you know what I'm talking about. This letter went out either email or text to say you're in, you're, you're gonna get $*** in credit incentive. Mhm. Yes, I see it and I know what you're talking about. But it it'll be paid to me. It'll be paid to me. You see it? You see it? I know exactly what you're talking about. No, I don't see that application, but I know what you're talking about. So what it is is an application is approved. You can expect a $*** rebate check after permission to install. So within ** days of that. So uh. Oh Oh. Oh Oh. Why don't all the, why don't all your colleagues know this? Why don't all your colleagues know this? Oh my God. OK, I'm gonna be real with you. I'm gonna be so honest with you, Ms. Stevens. I didn't even know. All I did was a Google search. That's all I did. While you were talking about it, I was searching on the internet to see what I could find regarding Pico and $*** incentive, OK? It's not part of the training at Positent to defend my colleagues, but it is our job to research. So I You what? So I did, I did do some research I found that here and let me see what I can send to you and see if I can access this application myself. Right. Oh my God. OK. But I filled out the form and I sent it into them. Yes, ma'am, I did that. So you did? OK. So, but send me whatever you're gonna send me that way I can argue with them tomorrow and, you know. OK. So what I'm, what I'm looking at. Because I, I can't. Mhm. Mhm. Go ahead, go ahead. No, what I, what I was looking at is is their website and it says to click here to learn more, so that's what I'm doing and it's talking about solar rebates, get the process it says customers apply online, apply by email, fax, frequently ask questions, get answers here, apply so you've already submitted the. Uh Mhm. Application so we just need to know what's next, right? Your fault. And that's all. OK, so let's see what it says. If you need assistance, call ****-IO Save, which I, I imagine that's the number you've been calling. Wait a minute, let me see because I got a hold on. Let's see, let's see the frequently asked questions. ***. What is it? What's the other? Oh, let me go back. Uh, it is ***-***-****. OK, OK, good. Don't have that. *th grade * that I just gave me that. He just gave me that. OK. ** minutes ago he just told me that right. Oh my goodness. OK. All right, so that's, that's their, uh, phone number for help if you for about these rebate processes, um, let me look at the FAQs and see if it'll give me kind of like an ETA on on how these turn around. Mhm. Uh, let's see. No, that's not helping. It just says do solar additions qualify? Do I need to submit an application? Where can I apply for the residential solar rebate? Our business is eligible so nothing about following up on that. So I guess I would just use that phone number. Mm. Because I don't see anything else that that's available for that. Let me just dig a little deeper here, see if I'm not missing anything. OK. He, he tried to transfer me. He was really helpful and he took the time like you are now. Mhm. Oh, that's good to hear. And everybody, oh no, that's not. Yeah, so he took the time and then he tried to transfer me and we were just. Well, that's. So, you know, things happen. Yeah, that happens too yeah our phone system isn't the best I'll tell you that when we transfer sometimes it'll go through and sometimes it won't but yeah that's definitely the phone number I see on the website and that's the only information that they have there's there's really nothing else it just gives me links for the applications, but you said you've already done that. Sure. OK. Do they say what do they say what the name of the application or can you send me the application through the portal or something? Yeah, absolutely, let me, let me see if I, well, I don't know if I can send it through the portal, but I can download it and send it to you. Oh Hold on. You can email. Yeah, let me, let me just see this is if this will let me submit an online application PDF. Mm. Residential natural. OK, I'm looking for the one. Yeah, PDF forms is cool. These are, this is natural gas, commercial natural gas. This isn't it, this is different. Uh, I don't have that. Yeah this is different. Hold on. Mm.

That is correct, you know, don't go anywhere until it comes through. All right. All right, stay with me. Go right there I'm gonna put solar rebate form in the subject so if you ever lose it you can find it again. Oh yeah. Mhm. Um awesome. Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm just, I'm just glad to know that they offer these kinds of things now because I've been in solar for so long now. Mm And this is, this is actually something that I've just become familiar with working with positgen and being exposed to Northeastern because I'm in Texas and I've been in in solar in Texas since it started ** years ago.

He's not responsible for anything because nothing is on his home. But what I'm telling you is I cannot cancel it. You would have to take that route and, and get it canceled. I can't. Oh I, I understand that, but why is it saying, why is it saying? That's all I'm telling you. Why are you telling the homeowner that he signed the SOW when he didn't? I said, I did not say the SOW I said his name is on the lease. That's what I said. The scope of work is totally different from the lease. He never OK, so edited, I, I think there's just a, uh, a confusion. You didn't sign anything. There's nothing signed. You're in cancellation, so you don't have to worry about anything. I don't know what what the confusion was. So. You would need to get that canceled out for him. Can you hear can you hear me out of that?

16a3615d-d7b4-49df-ac95-d9bb284ada34,"Thanks for calling Posen. My name is Joanne. Whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Hi, my name is Lydia. How are you? I'm good, Lydia. How are you? Uh, I'm good, but I'm a little bit upset because I already talked to the sales rep. I'm gonna cancel it. I don't want to go forward. And then right now I received a document saying that your document has been completed and the worst thing is there is my partner's signature in there which actually not her signature. Oh, I see. But her name is in there. OK, so let me just make sure that I'm submitting the request for cancellation to the right account. Is this for [REDACTED]? That's correct, yes. Alright perfect so then I do see a request um in process here I'll let them know that you requested cancellation with the sales partner. I'm not sure why we didn't get that message, but I'll be sure to send it to all parties that need to know. So what's next? Um, what's next is After this, after you report it. Well this is gonna go through cancellation if they need to follow up for any reason they might call you and email you but other than that I don't see what what else would need to be done. I would say if you have it. But why there is a document is just being, yes. I'm not sure I'm not sure what that is. Let me look here what document we have. I would say if It says that your document has been complete, yes. I would say that if you haven't already signed the and send an email to cancellations at Positgen I would suggest that you do that. What is the, what is the email to cancel it? Because it says in here, it says, hold on, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But on the document, it says that I have to cancel within * days. Now, at that time, nobody telling me about I have to cancel within * days, but when my sales rep calling me, I already talked to him that I'm don't think that I wanna go through with this. Um It's canceled. Mhm. Yeah. Right, I understand. And, and then on, yes, and then on March something I think I already let me see, let me see the text message in here. On March **th, he sent me a text. He said that, hey Lydia, I know you choose not to move forward with the solar project due to the level of savings, but also wanted to reach out as you had mentioned some other properties that you own, which so I have another property, but on March **th, he already know that I don't want to move forward with the solar project. Right. OK, again, I'm not really sure why we didn't get that message, Lydia, but I'm submitting the request now. I would just ask that if you would send an email to cancellations@pogen.com. Right. Can you, can you CC me also on the request that you sent? Sure. Well, I've already, I've already submitted the request. There's a case I can give you that case number. Let me see. So I can have it right now. OK. What is the case number, please? It's *****. Mhm. ***. Mhm. ***. OK. I'm gonna tell you the reason why I don't want to go through that's if you can, but That's fine. It's fine. You can, you can tell me it's fine, Lydia. OK, OK. Yeah. Yes, the reason why is because that I already calculated and when my calculation is I only saving like around $*** a year, but I have to be in the contract with like at least ** years. I don't think that's worth the contract, that's worth the saving not worth the contract. I don't think so for only $*** a year. If I can save my my pickle bill at one point goes up to $*** a month. If I can save like $*** from that $*** that's maybe still better, but every month I only save like around $**.** dollars. I don't think it's working. Right. Right, right, I understand. Yeah. OK. So, what is the email again for the cancellation? It's cancellations, so, so plural with an S at the end at positgen.com. Cancellation at Hogen.com. Alright, so cancellations with an S at the end, cancellations at positives.com, yes ma'am. OK. Yeah, the one, the one that make me upset is there is my partner's signature in there, which is actually not her signature. So that one is really, really like electronic generated or something. But that's not make sense. I'm only me, the one that goes with him at that time. My partner is not even there because she just have a baby. Mhm. Oh, well, congratulations on the baby, but I'm not sure, I'm not sure how they got that signature. That's that's that's. thank you Thank you for that. But that, that's something that's really It's, it's, it's, it's really not right, ma'am, really. Exactly. I mean, yes. Please, please, please, please, please take a look at this completed document list under my name, under my property. The only person that meeting me and Josh only, Josh Bla, I think that's his name. OK. And then for some reason, There is a like, like, you know, like, like a handwriting signature, which is, which is impossible handwriting signature because there's no paper, there's no paper paper list anymore. Right. That's, that's the only thing that upset me though. I understand completely. I would, I would be upset too. That's, I, I mean, I'm being honest, yeah. Yes. Uh I hear you. So no worries. I've submitted everything under this request here for cancellation. As I mentioned, just follow up with an email to the cancellation team so that they hear it from you as well. I mean, yeah. Yes. OK. OK, that's fine. OK. Uh, what's your name, ma'am? Alright, anything else I can do? Oh, my name is Joanne. Yeah. Uh J O A N. J O A N N * Ns, uh huh * Ns. Joan. ** N. Oh, OK. Do you have ID? So I will, I will mention you also that, you know, you're, you're really like, uh, give out a very good empathy with me, so. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that. I definitely appreciate that. Um, I don't have an ID number. I'm just the only one in customer service by this name. So I'm not aware of anybody else named Joanne in the in the company. Oh, OK. OK. OK. Thank you. So let me make sure, OK? It's it's a regular one cancellation with S in the back at Poygen.com. Right. That's it. Yeah, OK. OK, thank you so much. You're welcome.

OK, because I want to go ahead and send you over the instructions to set up online that's if you want to, um. Oh, you're way ahead of me because I was just about to ask that. Yes sir, just for the payments there this is not for you to see what's happening with your panels, but if you'd like to do that I can also send you a link in order to do that as well so you can see like how they're producing. OK. Mhm. So, So, I, I'm a novice when it comes on to this, I want you to educate me because I just bought this home with, with it, with it on it whatever now. Uh-huh. The the $** or $** the $** that I'm paying or show how mounted it, I'm paying. Mhm. Is that that's separate apart from my electric bill, correct? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Or is it, is it OK, no. Um, how does it tie in number one with my electric and what it's supposed to do? Mhm. And then *, Um, Does it, how does it alleviate because I'm gonna get, I, I just paid $*** and something bucks on the electric bill and then I got another bill coming up for another $***. So I'm like, where is the cost saving or so, so yeah, I wanna know. Mm. OK, um, absolutely. So ideally, the way the solar panels work is, um, you have the solar panels. First, what you're paying for are the panels, not the production that the panels have, that's a plus, but what you're paying for is the equipment itself, right? Um, and if for whatever reason the equipment is not working, then it's our job to come out there to get it fixed. That's in your contract. We're gonna fix it to make sure that you are paying for working equipment. Now, if the panels are working in perfect condition. Mhm. Mhm. OK. Then it allows your you to be able to produce a certain amount of energy out of that energy that is produced, you get to use a good bit of that. What you do not use is what you get to sell back to your electricity company, what you do not use, OK? Now, coming out of the winter time, winter time. OK. You're not gonna have as much production in the winter as you do in the summertime. We call that high bill season. Um, for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's colder temperatures, so the sun is just not able to be able to produce as much because of the cloud covers, right? Number *, it's going to be shorter days. So if you're not able to produce this much, then you're also, and you don't have as long to be able to produce, all of that affects the production of the panels themselves, OK? OK. Mhm. Um, however, as it warms up, you should see an abundance of an increase in your production here as it warms up. Um. Mhm. So If for whatever reason you don't see that production, we can take a look and see what's going on at it. I'm actually gonna look at your um production right now to see because if you said you've got a bill for $*** that's a little, um high, so I wanna check right now to make sure that everything is producing as it should be for you. Yeah, so Yeah, so let me see here, yeah, so I just paid. Uh, that one was March **st *, I'm $*** and then. Mhm. I'm already seeing next month bill that is due on the **th which is $*** and I'm like, OK, I mean that's. Hm. You know, Yeah. We wanna get that. I wanna just see, take a look at it to make sure everything is as it should be, OK? Thank you. Yeah. OK, yeah, from what I can see here, the panels are producing as they should, they should be an expectation. Last month for March you actually produced *** kilowatt hours. That's just under what should have been produced. What should have been produced was ***. It's just under. So far for April, you are still producing within that amount that should be allotted. You produced **.** so far. Um, so maybe it's still cause we've got a lot of rain. Maybe this, you know, we gotta let the temperatures warm up a little bit more. Um. Yeah. I do always say the wintertime is considered that high bill season and we are still, we're just coming out of it going into spring. So that could be what it is. Um, let's give it a little bit of time, see if it's gonna warm up, but you should definitely see an increase in your savings as it warms up, OK? Mhm. OK.

ea5643ff-576d-4870-92fa-40584dd3102c,"and solar, this is Ali speaking. How can I help you? really Hi, my name is uh Juan Martinez, sorry, and I got the inspection for my solar panels were approved. And I was supposed to call, but life happened and I'm just remembering to call now. So I wanted to know what's the next process. Hello. Hello? Hello. Hello? Ma'am, can you hear me? Hello? Yeah, now I can. Yeah, now I can hear you. OK, I'm sorry. OK, wonderful. I is this ** at [REDACTED]? That's OK. Yeah. Yes, correct. OK, OK. Uh, just one second, let me take a look at your project. OK. One second here. Mm OK, Ms. Martinez, I see that they did, they did get the notification that the inspection passed. Um, the next thing what they're going to do is they're going to have to schedule an inspection with the utility. OK OK Um, so, uh, what they, the lady normally ask you what days you're available, but, uh, you know, you can give that to me and I can give it to her. What, what days are usually best in times? OK. Um Well, I always, there's always somebody at the house, so if Oh, OK. Yeah, there's always somebody at the house, so it doesn't day and time doesn't really matter. OK. Well, actually late morning, early afternoons would work best. Late morning, early afternoon. Morning. Yeah, if it's possible. Yeah Sure, sure, sure. OK, so I'm gonna reach out to the coordinator that uh speaks to the utility company. And I'll give, I'll let her know, I'll give this message and what she'll do, she'll, she'll see uh what the utilities um schedule is like and then communicate that with you. Uh, once we do the, once they do the inspection, what happens is they usually go ahead and schedule um the, the actual meter to be changed out, and they will go ahead and usually schedule that with you and then, um, we usually wait for them to give us permission to operate, meaning to turn on your system, OK? OK. Got it. OK, because, um, the meter, I'm not sure if it's, but I don't know if we're talking about the same thing, but the meter already came and got switched out, and we had, if I'm not mistaken, I think we had Eversource and somebody from the city of Waterbury come check out because everything's already um set up. I think the only thing that was missing was um to get it turned on if I'm not mistaken. OK, so what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna reach out to the coordinator that speaks to the utility, and I'll just let her know. But, but you, you do definitely know that it was switched out, the, the, the meter? OK. Mhm Yeah, because we had um we had the roof checked in and everything was installed, then, um, Eversource came in and then they just did the inspection of like everything. I think about I'm not mys are all over the place. If I'm not mistaken, I think they did it like * days, uh, * weeks ago, and it wasn't inspector that came in and told my mom that everything looked good and then that was it. Mhm. OK, OK. Well, well, if that's, if, if that's the case, then because that's the usually what takes the longest is to get them out there and change out that meter. So if they went out there, then that's really all they need to do is uh just give us the permission to operate, which that's, that's pretty, you know, that doesn't take time. And then you'll get a call from our department to turn to instruction on turn it on. So let me uh communicate this with the coordinator that uh speaks with the utility and let her know and then um go from there, OK? OK. OK, OK. Alright perfect and then is there somebody specifically assigned to like my area for me to call like if any questions or do I just continue to call like the regular customer service number? All right. Mhm. At Let me see because we did switch, um, we did, they did create a new department that does that that um but depending on when you're. Your project took place, uh, so I don't think so. Yeah, cause that's a fairly new department that we started, um, but you know what, I can give you my number and I can give you just any follow ups and and um try to assist you until, cause you're almost, you're right there, so I don't mind assisting you. Oh, OK, OK. Mhm Um. Yeah, we're almost at the end. Right, right. Uh, do, do you want me to, um, I, I don't know if you're driving, do you want me to text you my number and my name? Mm Yes please that would be perfect because I am I'm on my way home. OK, yeah, I can, I can text you my name and my direct number and that way you can call me directly uh for any updates or any questions you have, OK? OK, that works thank you so much.

8d94b21c-daa6-45e6-989b-fac5dc9dd65d,"Oh hello. Hi, Mr. LaRosa? Yes. Hi, this is Gabby with Hasage and Solar returning your phone call. Hi, how are you doing? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm OK. All right, let's see what we got here sir thank you so much for taking my call. Oh, let's see here. OK, so it looks like we did a bill review. And the panels only cover was it discussed that the panels cover about **%. It's they're saying not even **% of what they said they were gonna cover. So, and like, and if I knew this from the get-go, I would never agree to it. OK. Um, let's see here. I'm looking at. I, I only have one page. Mr. LaRosa, and it looks like this is from ****. Do you have anything current? I know that the system turned on September **th of ****. I have, I have a bunch of, I have a bunch of bills current, but you gotta understand, I sent in a year's worth of things beforehand. Right? And so it's saying what I was what I was making, what the, the house was using. They looked at that and they told me whatever they were putting on the house was gonna cover everything. Mhm. And then when the guy was looking at it, he goes, no, that's not true at all. He goes, it's covering maybe half. So it's really, really Uh, I was really, really misled into what you guys were doing. Mm. You understand this is a really big problem because if you guys really misled me to what was happening. But what the solar panels would cover. And now you guys put holes in my roof and everything. I'm like, this is a big deal, OK? This is not like this is not an easy thing. And I've been trying to talk to you guys for a while, and I haven't, this is the first time I've gotten a real call back since I made my biggest complaint. Mhm. All right. So, like, even if you look at what my prior year was to what you guys put on the house. You guys still miscalculated by **%. OK. OK? So you guys have been overcharging me for what you guys have been producing and it really you guys haven't been producing much. And if you guys weren't gonna be able to produce that much. You guys should have never, ever, ever approved that. OK. OK. So, I'm very, very, I, I, I feel like I've been Uh, with the, with the lack of term bamboozled, OK? Alright. Right. So, I've been overcharged for so long. I, I was misled. And then I'm just like, there's no, at no time in, in this whole like the couple of years that I've had you guys, you guys have even produced anywhere near of what you guys said you're gonna produce. I understand. And so all I did was, all I did was add another, another bill to my uh my repertoire of bills. OK. OK. So this is like, if I would have known that from the beginning, I would have never said yes. Never ever said yes. Yeah. Right, right. I understand. OK. I understand and I, I do apologize for the frustration, um, Mr. LaRosa, uh, just kind of, as you were speaking to me, I was just reviewing everything. It, it appears that there was some kind of change that happened. Um, during the lease agreement, cause when I look at the original lease, you're going to get a * kilowatt system and I see the payment was gonna be $***.**. But then there was a change order. Um, and the change order, you know, says that the contractor and owner agreed to redesign. The system So it went from $*** from a * kilowatt down to $***.**. And this was for now a * kilowatt system. So it, it went, it looks like the intentions was to give you a *-kilowatt system, but then there is an agreement here that says that you and NYSS agreed to downgrade. Do you know what happened there? What, no, this is the deal is they told me whatever they were putting on my roof would cover my electrical. Problems, like whatever. The cost should be. They told me at a certain price, ***. And then when I Everything was signed up and done. They started charging me *** something. Let me see. Which was not what I agreed to. Oh, OK, OK, gotcha. So they never changed it. OK. And then, and then I told them I'm like you guys need to change this. I'm like because that's not what I agreed to, that's not what I signed to, so they reassessed the price to ***. Yes. Mhm. But, and, and even that being said, I was told that when they were putting on my roof was going to cover my electrical cost for the month. Mhm. And all I would have to pay my PSCG pi, which is the electric company that I'm associated with is just the line fee. And I've never, ever dealt with that. I've always paid way above that because you, it's not producing what you guys said it would produce. OK. That is my main problem with what's going on. And then when I talked to the guy about it, he goes, yes, no, this is producing about half of what you need. So, this is a big, big problem. And I, I like, I like, I've just been like, cast aside with what, what was going on over there about the problem. It's a big problem because if you guys are not producing what you said you would produce, that, that's, that's, that's not, that's a breach of contract. Mhm. OK. And then you guys already drilled holes in my freaking roof and everything. And if you guys can't produce what you said you were gonna produce, I want that stuff off my roof. Mhm. And I want my roof replaced. Cause now it has holes in it. I understand. OK, so I don't know, I don't know what's what needs to be done on your part or what you guys can do, but it And this is a big problem that needs to be done cause this is, this is a breach of contract. I've already talked to a lawyer and everything. He goes, he's like, no, if they said they were gonna produce this and they're not doing that, that's a, that's, that they lie to you. So, I really need this, I really need this to be uh rectified. Uh, I, I, I need everything to be done. Uh, I, I can't deal with this. Right. Yeah. Right, right. And again, I'm so sorry about it. Let me, let me check on the system. To see if it has produced what we promised in the change order, OK? Um, hold on just a moment, sir. Let, let me check on it. Mhm. Thank you. Mhm. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. Hello, Mr. LaRosa. Yes. OK. Thank you so much for patiently holding. All right. Now, let's see here. I did a calculation here um from our monitoring. So from April *, **** till now, April *, ****, um, that system has generated. Um, *,**** kilowatts. The change order says that we guarantee first year production *,*** kilowatts. And so it does appear that the system has met its guaranteed production. However, what I can do for you. Yes, um, I will contact New York State solar. Um, because they are the installers of the system who you originally started with, and we are in partnership with them. I will let them know of this conversation that you're not seeing, you know, any savings in your bills. And what we discussed. It would help if possible, sir. I know you said that you sent over a year's worth of bills, um. Let's see here. I think I've got. * I'm just pulling up this other case here and see how many bills do I have. From you, give me just a second, just looking at this. OK, so I'm looking at a bill you sent. Um, the image is kind of blurry. So I am looking at a PSCNG bill that you sent and the reading was from July **th to August **th. Um, is there any way possible that you can Send me either a year's worth or the, like the last * months. It's just something that I can present to New York State Solar with this case. You Send me an email. And I will attach Um, a couple of bills to that email and send it back to you. OK. All right, cause I've already I've already done this, and this is how I found out. Besides the fact that that I've been getting charged an obscene amount of money for the, the electric bill. Mhm. But I will, and you guys uh told me who uh there's a guy named. Jesse or Jackson or Jack or whatever his name is. Mhm. He went through it and he goes, yes. He goes, you're absolutely right. You are being overcharged. We're not producing what we said we would produce. Mhm. And he's like, we need to uh compensate you for this. This guy has been incognito ever since. And then every time I, I bring this up, everyone tells me he goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get back to you, get back to you, blah, blah, blah, and then nothing. No OK, alright, and, and I do apologize for that. um I do have your case. I have ownership of it and so I did send the email over to you just requesting those bills. As much as you can send me possible, that would be wonderful because I would like to make the calculations and present it to New York State solar and say this is what we have, this is the problem, how are we gonna get a resolution for this? Um, Mm, uh, it's, it's great that I, I brought this up, um, a couple of months ago and now I have to redo everything again. This is awesome. I love, I love the I love how things work. That's awesome. Yeah, and I'm, I'm so sorry that, you know, again, I'm so sorry that. So now, You're having this conversation again, but with me, I am the customer care team lead here and I'm very familiar with communication with New York State Solar. So the more bills that I have that I can do calculations and present to them, the better case I have to say, OK, what are we gonna do about this? Mhm. OK, yeah, I, I, I, I understand that too. But at the same time as I've already had this conversation with somebody that told me there's actually a thing that you told me just now, and now I'm doing it over again, uh, two months later, like it's never happened before. So if you understand my frustrations, I, I'm extremely frustrated with the fact that I have to do it all over again. I know. I'm Yes. And then yet you guys are still charging me the same price you guys still not producing what you said you would produce. You guys told me you would cover the prices and then uh it's, it's very, very, very, very, very. Very frustrating. And I know it's not your fault, of course. I understand that. But at the same time as Mhm. This is fucking ridiculous and that I have to do it so many fucking times over and over and over again. I understand. I understand. Yeah, I don't think you do. I don't think you care, but at the same time, can you please send me the fucking link so I can send this shit over again and so you guys can ignore it some more that that's fine, but at the same time I'm gonna stop paying the fucking bill until it gets resolved. Oh, Mr. LaRosa, I assure you, I assure you, and I am just just deeply empathizing with you, sir. I understand your frustration. I do. I understand your frustration. I see your history here. I just want to reassure you I'm gonna do the best of my ability in communicating with New York State Solar of what the problem is and present to them these bills and see how we can get this resolved for you. I just want to reassure that to you, sir. I'm so sorry that you're frustrated. I really, really am. I appreciate that you wanna help the fact, but what happened to the other guy that said he was gonna do the same exact thing? Well, you know, there, there is a bit of a difference. I know the person who you were speaking to. I am his team leader. I am, I am his team leader. OK, so then what happened with that? I, I, I initially contacted you guys in February. It's April. Yeah. OK. And then nothing would have gotten, I, I would not uh be talking to you right now if I haven't been pres Uh, been here and pursuing everything. So what happened in that time? Yeah. Yeah, they, we have had some changes, you know, we've had some changes, we've had some workarounds here, but I do see the case and, you know, I'm so sorry, you know, you're right, it's not an excuse, but I am. OK. Now, I have to do more and more work when you guys wanted to get me as a customer, it was uh so easy to get a hold of you guys and then it when it's the other way around. Now, there's a problem. Now, it's so hard. Now I have to work twice. So I, you know, I have to work too, and, and now I have to do this to make sure I'm getting ripped off. I, it's, I, I, I really, I'm not, I'm not happy at all, and I think I want you guys to take these things off my roof and I really think this, uh, like I want you guys to fix my roof. I, I really don't think I want to deal with this no more. I understand. And I'll use the bill that we have here. The only reason why I am just asking, you know, for it is because I, I just have one clear picture. You know, I've just got one clear picture and if I have OK. But if he was, but if he was able to to look at the what I sent. Over initially and then predict that you guys aren't producing what you guys said you would produce. Why do I have to do one anymore? I understand. Well, I will I will explain to them, you know, this is what I have, this is what the bills that were submitted, and then we can just go from there. I don't want to make you any more upset than what you already are, Mr. LaRosa. So I'll just use what you've already provided, sir, and then I'll just contact New York State solar. Mm thank you and I'll hear back from you guys from what next year? Oh no sir, no sir. I will task myself to keep you posted and up to date. OK, yeah, that's what the last person said too, sweetheart. Um, I'm sorry if I'm being rude and I really don't intend to be, but at the same time as I've lost my patience. I understand, I understand. OK. So, it's like the last person I talked to told me the exact same thing, and they told me to get it back to you by the end of the week. That was back in February, and it's now April. So, if you understand me, if I don't believe you. Uh, so, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to be rude, of course, but at the same time as I The, uh, please call me back tomorrow and show me that you're fucking mean business, please, cause otherwise, I'm gonna have a lawsuit and then I, I want everything off my roof. I want my roof fixed and like, I don't want to deal with this no more because it's not what I was promised. I understand, I understand, yes sir. I understand and I will give you a follow up call tomorrow, yes. Alright, thank you. You're welcome, Mr. LaRosa. Is there any other concerns that you would like to address with me? Um, that's it for now. Thank you. You're welcome, Mr. LaRose. It's been a pleasure speaking with you, sir, and I hope you have a wonderful evening. You too. Thank you. Good night.

16932741-4191-41f3-9887-44427015fd72,"Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Pos. This is Bruce speaking. Hey Bre Bree, um. OK. I've got a customer on the line. His name is Brett Darbone. He is trying to buy a house from Lammy Pig. Um, so I created a lease transfer case, but he has some questions about the entire process. Uh, now I wanna give you the case number I created. Uh-huh. Yeah, you can give me the case number. Is * ********. Got it, is this the buyer on the phone or is the seller? It's the buyer, that's the buyer. OK. You can send him over. OK. Uh, it's Brett Darbo, OK. OK. All right. Mr. Darbone? Yes ma'am. I've got Bree on the line for you. Alright thank you. You're very welcome. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Bria with Posen. How are you today? Hey, uh, good and you? I'm good. Uh, so Miss, uh, Ms. Lee stated that she has some uh questions about the uh lease transfer process. Yes ma'am and I was getting information on what. I'll put they put with the warranty on it. I got, I got a few questions. OK, um, when is the closing date for the property or did you already close on the home? The **th of this month. Alrighty, so April **th, so, um, our process is, is that, well, thank you for calling and I wanna tell you thank you for that. Um, we normally reach out to you all you all reach out to us, the buyer, um, and we go over the account with you in full detail, um, and things like that, answer any questions that you might have and let you know what we need next, uh, you know, to start the process. Now I can go over the account with you in detail and things like that and answer your questions or if you just wanna me to answer your questions and then we go over the account it's fine. He showed me the bill and what's left and everything like that, um. Mhm. So my question is, um, I think it's $**** left to pay on it. Uh, will the monthly payment still stay the same or is that interest or is there interest on that? There is interest on there? Yes. No, there's no interest on it. It's gonna stay the same, um, whatever he's paying, whatever his lease entails is gonna be your lease because you're, we're just transferring the services, um, and we're basically just changing the name on the account, but with that involves people work and things like that, but no, everything stays the same when he's paying you're gonna be paying. OK, what if I pay off the, the lease? I think it's *** left on it. If I paid that off, I wouldn't have a monthly fee, right? Right, so if you put the balance that's due on the account, you wouldn't have a monthly fee we would just pull from that monthly, but that doesn't purchase the system. That's just you putting a bulk payment on the account, um. Oh And we pull from it. I was told there's only **** left to pay them. I was told there's only *** left to pay off the balance. Right, yes, but it's, but it's not to purchase the system, it's just to. Pay off the balance if you want to go ahead and pay you still have to honor the remaining uh once that's left on the lease. So if you would to put the $**** that wouldn't purchase the system or anything that would just collections would just pull from that monthly instead of billing you. You'll still receive an invoice, but it, it will already be paid because they're gonna pull from it, um, until the funds is up now at the end of the lease you do have end of lease options, um, and one of those options is to. Purchase the system um and that won't be determined until at least * to * months before the lease is up because it goes by the market value, um, you can renew or uh basically renew your lease with us for * or ** years or you can have the system removed or you can upgrade the system which means getting a whole new system, um, and things like that so you have in the lease options. So it's a never owned solar system. Unless you purchase it, yes, you can own it, but you have to pay off the lease and then you would have to purchase them yourself but keep in mind if you do purchase the system, um, the system will be yours. So if anything happens to it, like whether you know if if something breaks on it or it goes down that you will be responsible, uh, no longer positing because you will be the owner, um, you would have to pay us or another solar company to come out and repair it. So there's $**** left on the lease from what I'm understanding, right? Yes. So that is ** years? Uh, let me see. See here, so there's. Give me one second. There's ** remaining payments left on the lease. Let's see here, because our system breaks it down by the monthly, no, so that's uh *.* years left. *.* years left on the lease. Mhm. OK, so my question is if I'm paying the lease and there's an issue with the solar system, y'all take care of it? Yes. Because we are the leaseholder, um, you know, so we're gonna be responsible for the system we're gonna take, we have to maintain the lease the system throughout the lease. OK. OK, so y'all clean the solar system panels too? We don't clean them. The system is meant to with staying any type of weather. The only time we will come and clean the system if we see that it's affecting your production. And y'all can see all the production that is doing and everything. Yes, the system is monitored by our monitoring team, um, so if something happens to the system, it also like if, if there's an issue. Uh, and it depends on the issue. A case will populate, um, you know, stating what's going on with the system that way our monitoring specialists are on it, um, yeah, and if it's needs to be, if it's something that needs to be corrected on site, we'll definitely schedule someone to come out there. OK, I got you. OK, what size system is that? Can I ask that? Yeah, that's no problem. uh I believe this is a * kilowatt, yeah, this is a * kilowatt. * kilowatt. OK, so. Mhm. Would y'all be able to answer uh the electrical company? Process or the electrical company would have to tell me? Wait, what do you mean? Like, do I get credit? So, as far as credit, I, I Like. I guess what you're meaning is, so the system is gonna produce on a daily, right, um, so you know the electric company does things by a month to month basis, right, majority of them, uh, ** days, right? So whatever your system uh so whatever your system produces, whatever you do not use in your home, you're gonna sell back to the electric company. What the electric company is gonna do is then take that sale back, which is the kilowatt hours you you didn't use and you're selling to them. Um, they're gonna take it and help lower your bills, so they're gonna apply it to your bill to help lower it, so it's not like a credit, um, that's why I wanted to just specify. So they don't pay me money they just pretty much give me a credit on my bill. Mhm. Yes, so they don't, they're not gonna cut you a check or anything or anything like that. And it's * and it's *. Alright, and at peak performance is * kilowatts a day. No, so it, it depends it depends. So the *, the reason why the system is a * kilowatt is the system is expected to produce **** kilowatts yearly and it's spread throughout the year. So your system can produce, you know, however much, you know, kilowatt hours in a day. It will be over *, I believe, * kilowatts. Or that month. OK. It'll be more than that. So it's * kilowatts average throughout the year. **** kilowatts. Yeah OK, I, I'm just trying to understand like uh monthly how much is it supposed to make a month? So that all depends, you know, so we depend on the sun, right? So. If we had Yeah, I'm saying peak performance like it was sunny every day. I couldn't hear your phone kind of broke up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, like if it was sunny every day, it was Bluebird sunny, it was at a peak performance for ** hours a day. How much is it supposed to make? Um, in a month So on average per month looks like the system is doing between *** to *** kilowatts per month and it's average, so that's month to month and it it can vary. Correct. OK, that answers my question right there. Alright, um, so that was it. You didn't have any more questions? And what No ma'am, whenever we close and everything, I'll give you a call and we can transfer or do whatever y'all want, however you need to do it. OK, uh, normally we do the process before, but if you wanna wait till after, if your, uh, lenders or, uh, you know, title company isn't asking this for, for this right now, then that's fine. But you know, once they start asking, you can always give us a call we'll, uh, get the paperwork over to you and things like that, OK? and collect what we need from you. Alright thank you ma'am. Alright, you're welcome thank you for calling in. bye bye.","A buyer called with questions regarding a lease transfer for a solar system.

We just, uh, did the solo with you guys, and we need to set up our accounts for payments and also to. To follow the How, how we're spending and stuff like that, so I don't know if you can help me with that or if I could go to a website and do on my own. Mhm. Mhm. Hang on. Guide me through that. Hang on just. I received an email from you guys. Uh-huh. Yes ma'am, I, I'm pulling up your information, so go ahead. OK. I received an email and I didn't do it, so our email is expired, so I can't really do anything as, as right now. OK, alright, well. Alright. Hang on just a second, I think, uh, yeah, because like. So your installation was done by Power Energy Solutions and it seems that uh that Kalo was trying to reach out to you in regards to. Yeah. Your activation, so. Yeah, To the activation for the, the monitor, but they do, they did came for. Yes. See what's going on around the house, see the windows. They did all of that. The only thing that we didn't do was the activation, not the activation, I guess the activation we could follow. Yeah. Yeah, actually that's what uh the cable was actually, uh, I guess she attempted to to give me a call on I guess it was either Thursday or Friday, um, and, uh, to, to basically just go over the information, um, with you, make sure we have a good uh good contact information for you, um, so, uh, because what happens is, uh, once the system's activated, uh, we go over this information. And then it sets we set up the uh uh the online billing and stuff like that for you um usually you'll get that bill, the first bill. Yeah, that's what I want. I want a link where I can. Yep, you'll get that first bill from from us. It'll come to you in the mail, um, and then once you get it, it'll have all the information you need, all the information you need to set up the uh online account, uh, by going to Pos.com. Um, so if you got a minute, I can go through that information and make sure we have all the information for you like, uh, and make sure it's all, it's all good, so. Oh, OK. Sure, and I, I wanna ask you one thing. We have two units, but we have upstairs and downstairs. They're separate bills, right? Um, Mhm. Oh, I. Or they one bill for to buy a house. Um, if there's * m, they would have, there would be two separate units. So Is there * m or * m? There's * m, yeah. OK, hang on just. There's * outside too. Yeah, um, so. Hang on just a second. So there's if there's * m then there would be, there would be, there would have to be two separate systems, one for each meter. Yeah, there, there are, there is one in the back, one in the front. From my understanding, I guess if you look, you might be better. OK. Mhm. OK. Yeah, hang on just a second, uh. Because I'm only seeing that you have one system with us and that's what I don't understand if you have two units you would have. And that's on the mosa. Uh, I'm sorry? That's under Melissa? That's under Melissa? Oh. Uh, this one is under, uh, uh, Julio, so, um. Who your rightaler, right? I'm sorry? Yes. That's under Julio Barel, right? And that involves both uh *st and the *nd floor. Yes, yes. Uh, it only shows me, it doesn't tell me whether it's two floors or one floor. It's just that one system, which I that's why I asked you if there's, there's. There's Oh There is a I think maybe, maybe I'm wrong then. I, I feel like there's * m but. OK, well, I, I don't know, but uh. Yeah Um, so I, I would, I would assume that there's there probably is only * m since there's only one system, um, but, uh, you know, uh, I mean, so, um, give me just a second and we can go over the information here, uh, real quick and, uh, basically do the uh activation here. Um, so it's [REDACTED]. OK. OK. OK. Correct. And I got the phone number ***-***-****. Yeah. OK. And then I got. That's one of the numbers where you can find me. Yeah, OK, I got an email address, uh, JC Barcelos**@yahoo.com. JC Bel correct. Yeah. All right. And that way. I just, it's just easier for me to communicate. Mhm. Oh yeah, I. To with you guys, but it's both of us. It's OK. That's not a problem. Uh, best way to reach you a phone, email, or text. Uh, best way phone or text. All right. All your texts. Yeah. Yeah, most people, most. I do check my email, but I work as a teacher, so I won't be able to communicate as much, you know, like from * to *. Yeah, I understand and I so so text is so much easier these days, um, and I understand that, so, um. That's why I missed that, and he did the same to me, but then he lost the email. Uh-huh, yeah, and, and see, text, text is easier, you know, and, and, but, uh, you know, we can always, we can always figure out if we try, if we try and we don't get a deal on one way, we'll try every way we can. So, but we'll start with the one you'd say first, um, so let me go over a few of the, the financial details of the lease agreement. Uh, it is a ** year lease, uh, the lease, uh, payments are ****. OK. Um, a month, uh, they do go up by *.*%, um, in the each year that follows, um, looks like you already got the auto pay features set up. That's $** that's $** is um. For the, the basic basic energy, like if I spend more, then I will have to pay more, right? Yeah, that that that that **** is the least payment for the system. What it, what it, what it generates, um, your, your, your, your house will use that electricity first before it takes it from the utility. Uh, if there's any excess, uh, production, it'll go back to the utility as a credit, um. And uh that that that that's how you actually build up uh that's how solar works you can build up credits with the utility company um to help offset the the times whenever uh because in the daytime. OK, I understand. So if I produce more, it will come as a. Yeah, it'll come back as a credit. Um, and now if you use more than the system can produce, utility company sends you a bill, and that that's that's the kind of how that works so. All right. Uh, so, like I said, yeah, so, um, you get your first bill in the mail. Um, it's gonna come, come to you, like I said, in about **, ** days, probably middle, middle end of May. Um, and then, uh, and once you get it, it'll have all the information that'll allow you to go online and set up the, uh, the online access so you can actually see how it's set up and, and all that stuff and, and make payments and, and see, see that. Oh, OK. I OK. Um, and then, of course, you'll, we'll, we'll send you a link that allows you to monitor the, the, the system, um, and you'll get that link, uh, probably here shortly, um, but it won't really be active until about the same time you get that bill. So when you get the bill, you can log in and and look at both of those at one time. Um, do you have any questions? Oh, OK. No, no, that's it. I just wanted to know because I thought I missed the email of the opportunity of getting, of doing what I have to do, so I do have to wait for the. There's nothing missed there, right? Yeah. That's. Now you just go, just wait for the bill to come in the mail um and then you'll be able to set it up, OK? OK perfect thank you so much I appreciate for your time. I just wanna make sure that I get the information right. Huh. Oh, no problem. Oh, it's no problem, no problem. All right, if you have it. Alright, and once, once I get the, the, the due, then I set up for the automatic payment, right? Yes, then you can set up uh for automatic payments. Well, the automatic payments already uh uh were already set up originally, but when you get the bill, you'll be able to log in and make sure that all that information is correct and it's, you know, if you're using a debit card or credit card or a bank account because it doesn't show me how it's set up, it just tells me it is, um, so, um, but you'll be able to log in and and and and if you need to change something or or update some information. OK. Uh, you'll be able to do it then, uh, and if you have, and if you have any uh questions or, or anything at that time, just give us a call back and we'll be able to to answer any questions you have.

OK OK, so when we have this it was Oh You know, part of this government program or whatever the hell we, you know, that's why we got it. And during our process in getting this, um, both the sales rep and then another lady that, you know, we talked to is a I don't know what she did, you know, um, it was like after the installation she made sure everything was right or something like that. They also say that during tax or during or taxes there would be a form that we would have or get or emailed or something like that that we needed to include for our taxes for the the energy credit or whatever the hell it is. Yeah, so the only, the only. So now you're saying because we're. Yeah, so the only like the only like real form there is is the uh you can use your lease agreement, um. But Like there are, like I said, there are some like programs and things, but it's kind of like state dependent, so that's why I don't, you know, specifically, uh, you know, I'm no tax professional, um, but for like a lot of the big tax credits like the federal tax credit and stuff like that, those you, you can't, uh, you can't file for really, um, but I would check with your tax guy and just let him know, you know, your, your solar lease and see what uh what energy credits you may be able to apply for. So OK, so basically what they told us in the beginning is not true then. Is what you're saying because like I said, that was one of the main reasons why we got this is so we can get that credit at the end and that's, and your personnel said that that would happen. Yeah, so again. So I checked with my. Good. I'm, it's fine. I was talking like that. I do my taxes to HR every year, so, um. But OK. It does, like I said, it doesn't make sense because that's what we got told in the beginning, one of the reasons why we went ahead and did that so we can call qualify for that. OK. Uh, yeah, that, you know, I'm not sure if there's some, some specific they were talking about, um, but, but typically, most, most like tax credits require you to like purchase and own, um, and not lease. Yeah. Usually. Uh, yeah. So, I, I, like I said, I'll reach out to them and see what they say. But if they say that there is. All right Um, if there is some credit whatever, do I reach out to you to get any information, or is it just, you know. Yeah, pretty much. You guys, I mean that's it.

Is now a good time to go over some account information concerning your solar system? Yeah, that would be great because we've had so many issues but um so I have a free *-** minutes. What's up? Yeah, um, well, first, this call is being recorded for quality assurance and training purposes, and I just wanted to extend a warm welcome to our solar family and to tell you a bit about Posogen, we served over **,*** customers just like you since ****, and Pasagegen has assumed all rights, obligations, and responsibilities of your current lease agreement. So, just to confirm, I have the name here listed as Brian Man Mancino, and the address is listed as awesome. Um, the address is listed as [REDACTED]. Is that accurate? OK. Yes, me, me and Tina. Correct. Awesome, and I have the phone number here ending in **** and the email is listed as BIM***@gmail.com. Is that accurate? Correct. Awesome, and would you prefer to be contacted by email, phone, or text, Brian? Oh. Gotcha. Thank you so much for confirming that information. Um, so what are some things that you would like to, you said you had a few issues, what was going on? Yeah, I mean, the Whitman construction guys came, uh, it took a while for like there was constant requests for the permit from the town and then it wasn't drawing enough from the solar. They didn't know I was white, so they put in a complaint to you guys or uh inquiry to you guys and then you guys were looking into it, but like um my bill should never be over like *** bucks max and they said I just wanna make sure I'm understanding right they said that whatever I overpaid. Mhm. Mhm. I will get reimbursed at the end of the ** months based on the consumption. OK. So, cause I see that your system was activated in December ****. So you should have definitely seen a difference on your energy bill from that time. Have you seen anything yet at all? Now, this month I did, the last * months I did, a huge difference. So it's working well now, but they, I just want to make sure that what they told me is if there was any discrepancy, I'll get refunded at the end of the ** months. OK. OK. OK. OK, got you. Like at the end of the year, yeah, I just wanna make sure that's right. Like, basically if I draw enough energy or I overpaid more than I consumed, I'll get the difference of the two. And I definitely I'm gonna create a case to make sure that um Whitman Construction gets that inquiry from you um so that they can give us a clear answer on that. I just wanna be sure when was the what was the time period that you noticed that there was no savings? From like December till till the month end of February. OK. So usually your system, like I said, was activated um on December **th, ****. And we usually ask that you give it about ** to ** days after your activation date before you start to see a difference on your energy bill. So that could potentially be the reason. But if you already discussed with um one of this, you know, representatives over there that OK. Yeah, they put in Yeah, they put in a uh inquiry or whatever from Whitman to you guys because they couldn't find the answer was going on. So, um, and they had the lady read over the contract in sight that we would get the difference like if if we over I'm overbilled and I consume more than enough, then I would get the difference that money back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. I completely understand. I just wanna, you know, be clear with myself so I know what to notate in the system, um, and to give you an idea of what the possible answer to your, you know, curiosity on that would be, um, is because we, it takes about ** to ** days after activation before you actually see a difference on your energy bill. So that could possibly be it, but I'm still gonna put that inquiry in for you, OK? OK. OK. Oh fuck, I got in a car accident. No, are you OK? Oh my goodness. OK. Um, gosh. OK, bye. Yeah let me let you go. Alright, I gotta go by.","Customer called to inquire about billing discrepancies after solar system installation.

I'm an active dealer with you guys. Hello, Lucio. Uh, how can I help? Yeah, the reason for the call is, um, I submitted a project, uh, last week and it got kicked back because it says that um it didn't meet the savings threshold. OK. And The, the amount that um the representative was suggesting we discounted to was, was, was pretty steep, like, like almost to the point where we wouldn't even be able to do the project, um, and it seems like there's a bit of a discrepancy, so I just wanted to get clarification on that because I do think it was a mistake. OK. Got you. OK. Do you remember who specifically you were you were speaking to? I could pull it up right now, yeah, one second. Oh Oh Bear with me a moment to find it. Here we go. Um, I think it was from Erica Lapiro. Got you. OK, let's see here. I was gonna say, yeah, because a lot of the time it's uh it's our contract approval team on our corporate operations team that, that kind of deals with, with things like that. She's not actually available to be transferred to, um, I can certainly just shoot her a quick internal message, let her know you called, have her give you a call right now. Is is there someone in that department though I could speak with? Not here at this current moment. They are pretty much work remotely. Honestly, I kind of wish they were here myself. Um, but like I said, I could kind of just shoot a message to, to either her or to What do what do what do we do in situations like this then? I was gonna say, yeah, I can just shoot a quick message to either her or someone else on the team if you prefer to speak to someone different, um, and just have one of them, you know, give you a call back and if this is the same number that you'd like to be called at and just kind of, kind of pick up from there. Yeah, that's fine. Um, would you be able to tell me if we're supposed to have like a designated account rep because when we initially onboarded with Positen, I don't believe we were provided with an account rep, um, but I would imagine that maybe there is a point of contact we can reach out to for things like this. Yeah, yes. Yeah, I was gonna say a lot of the time, um, they, uh, especially as you kind of get deeper into things, they do go ahead and assign you someone specific. Um, I'm not sure if you already have one, if I'm honest with you. When you call, it usually, it'll bring up something showing if you had, if you did kind of have someone already attached to you. I don't see that here, but I mean, I don't think it's much of an issue to get one assigned to you. Um, but like I said, when I, when I shoot her, if you'd prefer it to be her, when I send it to her, I can let her know that and she can kind of get herself attached to things, you know. Oh no, I don't, I don't want it to be her. I don't want it to be her. I prefer it to be someone else. I would just, I would just like to know like is there, could we have a point of contact moving forward so that when things like this arise, you know, we can reach out to somebody. OK. I got you. OK. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, usually, um, once, uh, once the conversation kind of really gets going with our contract approval team, anybody on our corporate ops team really, um, usually one of their, their managers or directors kind of, you know, specially assigns whatever representative they feel like it is best to kind of work it. So yeah, when they, um, what I'll do, I'm sending the message over to them right now to that contract. Approval team, um, once they kind of get, kind of get the, the bearings about them or whatever, I'll, like I said, I'll kind of let them know, you know, that you'd like to have somebody assigned to you specifically, and then they'll may, they may talk to you a little bit about kind of what you're looking for and assign someone specific to you. Otherwise it'll be a manager maybe just kind of reaching back and forth with you just depending on whether or not that's easy. OK, sounds good. The number you called from ***-***-****. That's a, that's a good one for you? Yeah, that's the best number. OK, all right, sounds good. I'll go ahead and pass that over to them, have them give you a call right back. Would you be available for the rest of the day today? Uh, yeah, I'll be available. OK. All right, got you. All right, I'll go ahead and pass that over to him. I'm gonna give you a call as soon as possible. Cool. Anything else I can help with today? That's it. Thank you. All right. Yes, sir.

40c496d1-5cea-4d30-bfcb-ef4d3927d10d,"Thank you for calling Posgen. This is Jack speaking. How can I help you today? Uh yes sir uh I'm. I downloaded the app quite some time ago, probably about a year ago, but there was issues with it and they said stay tuned and anyway I guess um I've been trying to log into the app again to see how much solar I produce and I'm unable to do so. Hm Give me * *nd. Is this Mr. James Stel? Yes sir. Alright, over at [REDACTED]. Yeah, you know what's funny is I just got off the line with another lady who I could barely hear and she couldn't even find my information and you find it right off my number. Hm, you might have gotten rerouted, sometimes the routing on the phones is really funny, but in like a frustrating kind of way. Oh Uh, thankfully though, you, you came to me without having to get rerouted or anything like that. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah, I called my wife right now. I said text me a photo of the bill so I can get the right account number because she couldn't find my name or or address or anything. Oh. Sweet baby Jesus. I can see why you can't say anything. Yeah. That system gives us an alert for monitoring almost every other day. Why? I, I see production from the system. Um, Wow, that is a lot of disconnects. Disconnect, reconnect, disconnect, reconnect. Let me switch the daily view. It's a periodic thing. Yeah Literally almost every day it gives us an error. The error doesn't stick around long enough to trigger the automation to open up a case. Interesting. Um, I do see that somebody did manually open up a case for someone to go out to figure out why the system is giving us so many errors. And why the errors keep going away. Really? So we should be getting someone scheduled uh sometime soon to go out, check out the system. Um, Good news is your production's about where we would expect it to be. Um, bad news is. We don't know why the system gives us so many errors and if it's affecting anything to do with the system. You should be getting everything properly cause it'll only record actual output. It can't record non-actual output because it's it's based on electrical flow. Um, but all these different disconnect areas can't be good for the health of the system. So we'll get someone out there and get it fixed up. Could be something as simple as updating the communication device or even swapping it, but um your, your production should be perfectly fine. OK, so But, but I can't even, I can't even log into the app. Mhm. I don't I have no idea what my production is. Yeah, all these issues are gonna cause issues when the system tries to pull the data records from the monitoring site because it can't properly pull with so many uh communication errors being logged. The errors aren't enough to stop the system from producing, but every time it logs, it disrupts the upload process. Uh, so we're gonna have to fix that communication error first. Then we'll have IT, not IT, we'll have diagnostics to a rerun of the production numbers, and once that's done, then we should be able to upload everything onto the monitoring portal for you to have visibility. OK. OK. Yup. Um, Alright, will somebody contact me when they go out and look, or? You'll get a text message once it's been scheduled. Uh, they'll give you a text at ***-***-****. OK. Yes. And how, how long ago was that case opened up? Um, just recently in March. Um, they, um, there's an update to the monitoring platform, which is why the system now is able to see that there's an issue going on. OK. Ah, cause the, the monitoring platform prior had different. Different like specifications for what it considers to be an issue and open up that issue. Um, now with the new system is a little bit more sensitive and is able to pick up issues that it wouldn't normally prior. So in this case, because the system was meeting production expectations, it wasn't actually picking up that there was an error. Um, because the air kept appearing and then disappearing and appearing and disappearing. So we would never actually pick it up. But now with the increased sensitivity, it did pick up the issue, opened up a case, sent it over to diagnostics. And our diagnostics is working through all the um through the new cases. Uh, once they've got to your case, they'll take a look at the inverters, see if it's something they can fix remotely. If they are, perfect, you'll get a notification saying that it's been resolved remotely via um email. You'll get a case closed email. If it's not something they're able to resolve remotely, you're gonna get a text message from field services regarding an appointment date. OK. Thank you. Yes sir, yeah, thank you so much for calling, uh, um, to get an update on this. That's, that, that's all I need to know. Yep, uh, once we get the case resolved, we should then be able to get the communications and monitoring platforms updated so you can actually see what's going on. Alright. Thank you. Absolutely, thank you so much. And in case you're looking for another update, just feel free to give us a call. We're happy to assist. Yeah. All right thank you have a good day. Take care, bye.

Uh, payment made depositgen on the date that I went in the app and did it. Mhm. So it's kind of annoying because they, you don't really have the information to answer questions like this. I might have to just start mailing you the check myself and it, it's faster. Right. OK. Either way, no worries. I was gonna say, if we know that you did it in the app, um, they usually send it within ** to ** hours of whenever you do it in the app. So if you know what that, what day you did it, I'll just notate that date and say it was mailed within that time frame.

Wait, wait, but Chanel was uh in Saint Rose, wasn't she, or she was in Kenner, uh. Yeah, she, she lives in New Orleans though. She, well, not in, she lives in down there. I'm not sure if it's in New Orleans, but she lives down there in that area. Right. Yeah, we're in the same department. Yeah, that's my colleague, we're in the exact same department. Oh, OK, so Right. I love Chanel. She's my buddy. Oh yeah, she's very nice. Yeah, she's very sweet. I love her to death. She's a good woman. Yeah, I seen, I saw an email they were talking about the new batteries coming out. That that would be nice to have. I don't know if you saw that. Well, they haven't alerted us of it, but yeah, I've heard of it. I don't know when that's gonna happen. They haven't gave us a date or anything like that. Yeah, I got an email from Posit the other day and they were they had shown this battery and I guess you would have to finance it. Yeah, for sure. Yeah That would be nice to have. Um. Yeah, I'm wondering when they're gonna let us know when they're gonna be doing that. So I have a lot of inquiries about that. Yeah, I didn't read Oh, I bet, yeah, cause. That's kind of what sold me on the panels. I don't know, I don't know how long I've been having them. You might have that information in the computer. It's probably been over ** years though. And That was like part of the reason why I got the panels was because You know, they had been talking about having backup power too. Mhm. And um It just never happened, you know, and it's It's just You know, just like, I just kept hearing that, you know, it's gonna be a thing, it's gonna be a thing and um I'm just now starting to see emails about it. Yeah. But it's been um a while like. It's probably been, yeah, I'm sure it has been. Cause it's been a while since I've heard any new updates in regards to batteries. I know it was a hold for um some time and it's still from what I understood, it's still a hold. I just inquired about it a few weeks ago and he said, oh, it's still on hold. So I was like, OK. Yeah. So this is the, OK, so it might not be through y'all but it's the end phase IQ power pack. I don't know, I guess N phase is a different company but. Are they separate than the panels, I guess, um, posgen does the panels and then. that could be, that definitely could be. I wish I had more information about it. Let me see if we have anything anymore here. Yeah. Cause um when I get the, you know, every month I get a uh a readout on how much the panels made, you know, how much power they produced. Mhm. But it comes from a company called In Phase. Um, I thought that was Posen, but I'm guessing it's a different company. Yeah, in phase is definitely familiar to what I, um. Know of, so that definitely could be. Um, Uh, a merchant that we are with. Yeah, like, Let's see And they're the ones that sent the email with the this it's a huge backup power it's called the one itty bitty box. And um Says it powers your fridge, Wi Fi router, a laptop, coffee maker, TV, security system, and more, and it says buy now. Yeah, you can You could definitely, um, I believe they assign, um, once the battery comes, I guess it, they assign certain uh elec uh electronics to that battery, so that if you did lose power, those items would still run. Mhm. I think that's how it goes. Yeah, that would be nice. That's like. Pretty much all you really need. I mean, just the essentials. Right. Cause right now I have solar panels, but when the power, when the power shuts off around here like for a storm, I still lose power even though. I have solar panels that's supposedly getting energy from the sun, so it doesn't really make sense. Like it makes sense in a way but it doesn't. But you need something like a either a generator or a battery to back that up in the event of power outages or power loss. Right. Right, that would make sense because of like if I have a solar panel, why am I still relying on the power company? if the power goes out from the power company, it shouldn't affect my power, you know, like. But it does because you're, you're attached to the grid, so you're gonna lose power, but if you did have a battery backup and you have certain things attached to that battery, you will still be able to run your household, not completely at ***%. Attached. You know, maybe half of that certain appliances are attached to that. You still would be without, you know, grid power, but you would have certain appliances in the home that would still run like a refrigerator, um, any other electronics that you would want to still run smoothly in the event of a blackout. But again, I have no updates on the battery when that will happen, when they will be dropping those. Right. I have no idea when that's gonna take place. I know that probably a mass email did go out. To inform customers that that's, you know. And the uh And the path For it, but I don't have any, any further updates about it. I'm checking now just to make sure. Yeah, I got this email this is a um. Recommend this is a uh. It's from Nhase. It's a power pack **** for ****. So for almost $****. Um, uh. Recommended accessories. So no solar panel. I don't know what that means. You don't need solar panels with it? I don't know what that means. I don't either. But it's just battery. It's nice looking little battery, but I guess it comes with its own little solar panel. I'm not sure. Yeah, I guess it does. I don't know. I don't know if this is separate from like the solar panel that's on the house. Right. Yeah, no solar panels. The IQ portable delivers up to *** watts of charging power, connect the maximum of * panels up to *** watts. So I don't know if they would connect the panels on the house to it or if it comes with its own panels, but. They definitely are advertising these boxes, these little boxes, uh, for the house. And it and it and right. Yeah, I get what you're saying because I'm on their website. You see it on Nhase? In phase.com. It's a new day for solar power. So those. I mean, cause I, I run my business out of my house. So like that would be nice. I hate when the power goes out, you know, it's like. My business doesn't total it kind of does crash because my internet goes out and everything. Right, right, right, right. It's messed up, but it would be nice to have something like that. Like I think with solar panels, I shouldn't have to deal with that. So I would if I, you can always inquire and ask um that company if you have a phone number you don't have to whatever you do just inform us because it has to be compatible with the system so that you'll be and you could get the proper. Uh, service when when the uh Power goes out. Right. So, do you know how to tell how much am I even saving power with these panels? Like I don't even know cause. The electricity goes up every so often they charge more for electricity so it's kind of hard to say. Are these panels even. Saving me any money. I know like you can look on your bill. And you can see like how much power you're selling back to the power company. But I don't know how to do the math to see like. How much did I actually save that month? Do you know how to do that? Uh, let's see, we have that. Let's see, one second. Cause people ask me all the time, they're like, are the solar panels worth it? Are you saving money and I'm like uh uh. I honestly I, I honestly can't give them an answer because I don't know. Well, normally you see when you have a sell back on your electricity bill, somewhere will be where you will see a credit of cash, I mean, not cash, but like a credit on your electricity bill. I'm not sure how they apply it as a credit or if it stands out differently. I'm not sure how they list it as the credit on the uh. Ouch on the electricity bill. It'll look, it'll, um, it'll be like a negative whatever number um. Right. Like I could go to view my bill. Let's see and I can look at it and see. Um, Let's see, build breakdown, I guess. Let's see they breakdown. Uh, let me look at the PDF because that's the real bill. And it's like I wanna tell people yeah I'm saving money you know but. I don't know. And it's really hard to tell. Kilowatts use, it'll say the kilowatts that I use average kilowatts per day, **. So down here it says uh. Mm. Company kilowatts to customer *:**. Customer kilowatts the company -***. So that sounds like you're sell back so we know right there that you are your panels are working fine you're selling back you're getting. Your credits So net kilowatt hours is *** something. So basically, I used *** kilowatt hours but I sold back *** something, so I sold back. Half, so they're telling me I used up half, but there's no way cause this bill was like. I mean, are they saying my bill would be double if I didn't have the panels that just. Probably, yeah, because imagine if you didn't have the solar, you wouldn't have those credits. And like my bills $**. Would it be $*** right now? Or would it have been $***? Mhm. Probably, probably be more than that, especially with the rates going up and without solar. So imagine the, the amount you would pay full, you will pay for all of your kilowatts used instead you're only paying for whatever that percentage is that was left after the credit. That amount, I'm sorry, that amount after. So if you didn't have solar, it would be double that. So if it's just imagine that part of it of where it says. You said half of that **** or something like that, *:** something like that? You think you're talking about for the the cost of the bill? Yeah, remember you had said something that you said that was half of what you had used, something to that effect you had said? Yeah, cause it's saying it's saying that they, the company to the customer, so basically. The power company to me, they gave me *** kilowatts throughout the month. But it says customer to company. ***, so that's like half that's like that's what I gave back to them. Right. I guess with the solar panels. So the net, which is the *** minus the *** is. ***, so it's like half and half, it looks like half. Right. That's my neck, like that's my. You know, after my sell back and all of that. Right, so whatever was. That's what I actually bought. Right, so then the utility providers should be charging you for whatever you didn't use, not whatever you didn't use, but. The I'm trying to explain this like. It's normally whatever. Isn't part of the solar would be that times the rate. So whatever kilowatts that you was left out of your sell back that was *** and let's say ***. So now instead of *** being at the full price of the utility rate, half of that would be at the utility rate. Right. So if you didn't have solar, your utility bill wouldn't be $**. Mm. It will be all of the kilowatts that you that you had used from the provider which again is use a round number *** it will be *** times whatever that rate is instead of half of that at the rate of whatever the utility provider has, if that's making sense. Yeah. OK Yeah, I just. I guess I'm saving. I don't know, it's really hard to say cause it it it changes, you know, it's like. I remember my bill used to be at this time of the year. It's not even It's not even the full peak of summer yet. And like Well, Cause, yeah, cause like that's telling me if it's ** right now. It would have been *** already. So by the peak of summer it would be like *** probably. But I remember when my, my bill used to be like *** in the peak of summer, like, you know, ***, ***, so. You know I know cost when everything goes up but it's like. It's still really hard to say, you know, how much are you say because everything keeps going up, it's like. Everything, I mean, every single item, I mean, I'm just glad eggs went back down, that's all. Yeah, right. I'm just happy eggs is at a regular, regular price now. Instead of $** for * dozen of eggs. Yeah. But I think everything else is going up. The whole stock markets crashing right now. Yeah, that's just, hm. Sad to say, but this country might be headed for depression. But That's what it's looking like. I mean, I'm getting depressed, so yeah. I'm, I'm worried and sad and worrying about Social Security, worrying about everything these days cause Well, everything all in the way it is, you just, you start to think about everything like how this is gonna affect me later. Right. Right. Well, what can we do? Well, And just go along with it, follow the, follow what our leadership has to do and just hold on for dear life and brace for, uh, brace for impact. The worst Right, right. This Yeah. This person used to always tell me this, and they always say. OK. And then Expect, well, how it goes, expect the worst. something I forget the saying, but it's a saying goes, he looks out for the worst but expects the the least or something he used to say, and I'm like, why do you always say that? And he said, it's true. I can't get it right. So I'm saying it wrong. I know I'm saying it completely wrong, but it, it makes, uh, and it makes sense to me why he always said that, but when you just said brace yourself, it just brought back that memory. Mhm. Yeah, it's almost like uh expect the worst but hope for the best or something like that, something like that. yes, it is something like that. So definitely something, yeah, hope for the, yeah. Yeah. Expect at least to hope for the best you or something like that, yeah. But But yeah, Bye. That's what we're ahead of. Is there anything else that I may be able to help you with? All right, well, No, I really appreciate you. Um, I got to head to the store now. All right, well, be careful. But I'm sure we'll talk more in, talk more in the future. Yes, for sure. Yes, for sure. Right Like I said, it's better like if you wanna email, so I have your email, I'm sure you have mine. Yes, yes. Um, It would just be easier. I could just shoot you an email because I have to put money on that card. OK. For whatever reason, and then, and then like, You know how bills, everybody just starts attacking it at once and then it's like I gotta go back and check that card and it's like, oh, I don't have any money on that card so I have to reload it. Right, right. OK. OK. And I would just send her an email to rerun it and she would run it and everything would be fine, it would just. OK. It was pretty simple. It seems simple. It seems simple. OK, yeah, that, that is very, I have a lot of customers that I communicate just via email. They'll send me an email and tell me to run it, so it's not a problem. I can definitely do that as well for you. OK. Yeah, that's easier, if you think that's easier, so. It is. You're not calling or waiting and, you know. If the quickest response is email, I don't, I again, I don't mind responding. uh, I have them customers do it to me all the time, so it's not a problem. All right. Well, sounds good. All right. All right then, well you have a good evening, Mr. Perez. All right, Roshonda, you too. Have a good one. Thank you, thank you.","The customer's autopay failed.

8b4b74a8-8690-4fae-a12b-8eeb8ca9b82b,"Hello? Hello, good afternoon, Mrs. Watson. Hi, good afternoon. Hi, this is Erin with Positgen. Hi, yes, how are you? I'm fine how are you doing today, ma'am? I'm good, thank you. OK, I want to remind you we are on a recorded line. I was giving you a call. I know we, uh, we did have conversations maybe about a week or so ago. uh, I've been coordinating with our sales department. I know you wanted some information as far as moving forward with the additional system and you have some concerns, correct? Yes. Yes ma'am, uh, so the intention hadn't changed, uh, just from, um, my estimation that, you know, we would install the additional system so you would receive kilowatts because the bass system wasn't explained thoroughly upon sign on. Um, and again we would protect your roof for both systems. Um, You know, just moving forward if you were to have any roof roofing issues, you know, we would come out and service your roof accordingly. Um, my question to you is this, initially when, um, The contractor, um, he was introduced in the panels, the heart, he said that. Um, We could not get any more panels. So my question is like, how many more panels? And I know for the size house we have, we need a set amount of panels to run the entire house. So this new system that you're mentioning like. Mhm. How many panels or um do, are you talking about? And will this, will the system be able to run my entire house without having an issue? Mm. Yes ma'am, one moment, I'm gonna take a look at your opportunity. OK. So you were informed that the system. Um, Currently Basically covers your entire roof. And covers the entire house, the, the service. And that Oh, you wanna ensure that the amount of kilowatts that you will receive would be sufficient enough to cover, uh, a great deal as far as your, uh, utility bill goes, am I correct? Right, right. Correct, uh, since we haven't, uh, completed the sign on it doesn't look like the opportunity is in our system yet, so I'm not sure of the size system that you would be. Um, that you've been, you know, pitched or if we've come out to actually do some, uh. Additional sign ons have we come out to actually complete that uh. Additional sign on. OK. No, I'm, I'm asking, have we come out to. You know, speak to you about the system that you would be making payments for. Um, I didn't get that. Can you rephrase what you just said? Uh, has someone has someone from our sales department come out to, to, uh, pitch the additional I know that someone came out and that you have the boss' system, but has someone come out to, uh, inform you of an additional system that you would be receiving. No. OK, well, I wouldn't quite know the size that size system. I can look at the actual roof from your design just maybe um. I may be able to. Let's see if there is some roof space for an additional system um. And I'm sorry that you were informed that you didn't have any other roofing space if you were if if in the event that you do uh do have additional roofing space. You're asking uh if there is additional roofing space? Well, no, I, I, I heard that you said that you were informed that there isn't any additional roofing space for any other, uh, panels. Well, um, the guy told us that we weren't able to get any more panels on the roof. OK. Um, so, I The, the space is there. The space was there, but he said that whatever system is, is pulling up, we weren't qualified to get more, so. Mhm. Correct. Yeah, and I'm reviewing your roof. It does look it's a relatively large system that is installed onto your roof. Yeah, too big for not being, not benefiting from it. ** panels. We're not benefiting from that. Yes ma'am, it looks like you only have room for about, well, maybe you have room for about ********* panels. Which isn't the equivalent of **, so I do understand. Uh, Fully understand your issues. I don't, I'm not sure, uh, because of the utilities, it is difficult to get things changed over, uh, from basa to traditional or if we were to. Uh, lower the system's output. I don't know what we could do, but I'm, I'm going to attempt to do something. Um, is there something particular that you would, uh, wish to land on? Is there any resolve that you think would be desirable? Yeah, I'm still wondering like what will it take to get the vaso system of my um to get me out of this, this system that I did not clearly signed up for. I don't have a problem doing roof rental, but this, this, this system that, that, um, not working out for us like I wanna know, um, um, give, give me one minute. Yes ma'am. Um, hold on, my husband is actually here today, so I'm gonna have you speak with him because Mhm Mhm. I'm, I'm getting stressed out with this right now. Just give me one second, please. No No problem. Hey, what's up man? How are you doing today sir? Good, so right now we have ** panel, right? One side ** and the other side *, and that side available for a couple more panels. I didn't check, but you said around **, probably I'm probably a little bit more. I don't know. OK, what I'm saying is based on the contract that went down. Yes sir. Correct. *, about *. Mhm. Cause we got tricked into it, as she explained. Because the guy didn't the guy didn't told us that it was for rental. OK, he told us that, OK, based on what we are producing, we are overproducing energy, which we're gonna be pushing back energy in the grid. So it's like, OK, our electricity is gonna be reduced, plus we're gonna get additional payment on top of that because we're overproducing. So my question is, OK, we have * sides of the roof, all right, you guys have ** panels on one side and * on one side. Can you guys give us one side to benefit our house and the other side for you, you, you, you guys rental? I mean, I don't know. We have to work something out, or, I don't know. Correct, uh. ** side we could benefit from one side. Yes sir. And you guys benefit from the other side, but we can't just be left in the dark. We need to be produced, we need to be if we're putting panels on our own, we need to be benefiting from it, not just pushing back to the grid that doesn't, that's not helping us. Of course. Yes. Yes, uh, I completely understand. I'm not absolutely sure what uh what resolve we can get with the utility company. Of course I am gonna fight for, uh, getting it, getting as close to, if not exceeding your request. I wanna, you know, indeed satisfy the customer. It just isn't contingent on positing, so the error that was made initially by not explaining the complete bossa. Uh, it is cost it is costing us at the time and it is costing you as a customer, uh, we're gonna fight to do our best job at resolving it, um, but it isn't just, you know, our call, um, so if possible, you know, I'm gonna have to have some discussions with our operations team and they're gonna reach out to the utility and we're gonna see what we can do to, you know, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Just work something to get some happiness or just uh you know just a balance where both parties are content where it's good business. Yeah, because we reach out to, we reach out to the company in terms of the high electricity bill that we are having, you know, we need to get a reduction in our bills. So solar system is like, OK, this is the way we can reduce our electricity, and he come and explained to us, OK, yes, you know. Mhm. Based, he says **%, almost **% you guys electricity to be reduced all the way down, and he explained how much you guys will be paying and you guys will be getting this um per month because based on the location that our home is at on the roof, we are producing way more than the amount of energy. That we are using because we gave him our electricity bill. You look at it, you say, oh, you, we, we got based on the unit that we're gonna provide on the on the roof, you guys are gonna be receiving a lot more energy than you're using and then you're gonna be pushing back more in the grid and we're gonna reward you $*** per month. So no, when they told my wife, oh, the roof was for rental, the $*** was for rent. That was like a shocker because we didn't sign up for that. That's like we didn't sign up for that. That's not what he explained to us. And whatever you give us to sign on the lease, that wasn't even there because we read through it and that wasn't even there that the roof is for rental. So it's like we got tricked into it. So it's like it's a whole mess. Yes sir, uh, I understand. I'm sorry that you feel that you were tricked into something, um, that isn't our intent at all. uh, I wish that the system had been explained to you thoroughly so that you were able to make a decision that was, you know, more in line with what you, you know, you intend to get. Yeah Yeah. Um, I'm sorry that you feel tricked. I, I, my, I would, I can't speak for those parties, but I would really hope that the intention wasn't to trick you. Maybe some something I lost in translation or just wasn't explained thoroughly, uh, but my job is now to. I don't know, but the way, the way we, the way we explained it, it's not what they're saying now. The way we explain it is, is totally different. Mhm. Correct. Yes sir. Oh. I'm sorry for that. uh, well, my job is now to, you know, just try to make it right and just find some, some place of contention between ourselves and. Mhm Yeah, because if we could, if we could, because we have to meet somewhere because we are in a situation now where we have to meet somewhere. It's both parties we have to come to an agreement, right? So we have ** panels which you guys are benefiting from. That's what I'm saying ** on one side, * on one side, and you guys are, um, pointing out, putting out additional units which that's probably gonna be * or **. Correct. That's not gonna be enough, I think, for us, you know what I mean? So we already have * on that side, so that's what I'm saying. But if you can work out even in better favor, that, that, that, that's even good, you know what I mean, but we have to get somewhere, but we're not gonna, we're not gonna be putting an additional part in on our own. We're, we're still not gonna be benefiting from it. So You know, I mean, it's not gonna be reducing our liter to the bill at a at a at a certain amount because putting it in what is one thing, but how much is the * or ** panel gonna reduce our the bill. And then we get, we get, we get tied up in another contract. We're OK, another ** year contract with our roof is filled with panel which we we're not benefiting from it. So that doesn't make sense. So whatever we are going to, we'd have to be working in our favor because we already stuck with this ** panel where we didn't agree on rental. We agree on reducing our legislative bill. Correct. Yes sir. You know, so, Yeah. And I, I do understand uh the frustration. So just allow me to, you know, maybe get a couple of days. I'm gonna, you know, follow up with you as soon as I get the information but just allow me to get a couple of days just to gather all the information, see what we can possibly do uh we do have to work with the utility company, uh, and then we'll, you know, hopefully, you know, at best we can, you know, get you what you've requested or something better or close to it so that is my goal here just be patient with me and I'll, you know, I'm gonna fight for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. OK. Alright, no problem what's your name? My name is Erin Thomas and again I did remind Mrs. Watson that we're on a recorded line, but I, I didn't get a chance to remind you, but we're on a recorded line just for myself and yourself. OK. OK. Yeah. OK. OK. All right. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, so we look forward to hearing from you and hopefully um. Everything resolved in a, you know, in a, in good faith, you know what I mean? Because it's not easy for Our electricity bill is really high. I'm telling you, it's really crazy. We are, we are going through a lot with this bill and, and it's like, we are looking like, look, we have, we have solar. We just have it on our, have it on our roof, like, yeah, we have solar on our roof and we're still drowning in bills. So it's like, what the purpose of having this on our roof and we're not really, we, our bill is still skyrocketing. Yes. I can imagine. Yes. You know what I mean? Understand. You know what I mean? So, yeah. So, yeah. Well, I'm gonna So look forward to hearing from the year and and uh do the best you can because this is, this is uh You will. It's not a good situation right now to be in, to be honest. Yes sir, uh, uh, just give me a chance to work something out and I'll, you know, follow up with you with good news hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, alright, no problem. Yes sir, uh, you enjoy your day. Uh, this is my direct line if you, if you need to reach out to me you can call me on this number. Yeah, right, no problem.

73041b90-7bff-453e-ab75-dacea206d4be,"Thank you for calling Posit and Solar. This is Christian in customer care. Who have the pleasure of speaking with? Hi, my name is Amy Domain. How are you today? Doing well. How are you? Good, you want my account number? Uh, yeah, that'll work or address, whichever is easies. ***-*** is my account number. OK. What's your name? Christian? Christian. And it was ***-***, is that right? It is. Uh-huh. Gotcha. All righty. How can I help? And so I talked to Jack last week, and um we are at the end of our solar panel agreement. And um I need to talk to somebody about what we want to do as far as renewal with that. Also, we're having a roof put on, new roof put on on May *th. So I need somebody, can we go ahead and schedule somebody to come remove the solar panels so I can get the new roof put on and then put them back on. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, OK, so I will, I'll, I'll do two things at one time, uh, so we can, I can, we can start the conversation about the end of lease, um, at the same time I'm creating that case for you, and I'll just kind of let you know what you, what you have to look forward to as far as the removal of the panels. Um, did he already, when you spoke to Jack, did he actually present anything to you as far as kind of what your options look like? Sounds good. He did mhm and then um we want to talk about the * year um but I wanted to know what that payment looked like because and I and I'll just be real with you Christian, um, our solar panels have not been working effectively the last year um we were only making, we were only gaining $** to $** after payment, not the $** to $** we should have been, so I'm gonna need our payment to be reduced. OK. Mhm Got you. OK. For about * years, which he said was an option. Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, that's, that's certainly in the, in the cards for sure. OK, so as of right now, you're paying us $** a month, is that right? OK good. Correct, mhm. Got you. So let's see here and you said * here. Let's see. Right, so if I'm being transparent with you, of course, like I said, that is certainly an option. Generally speaking, and, and I guess I, I wanna have the conversation with Jack just because I'm not sure kind of how, how in depth your conversation was with him, but um I can tell you generally the, uh, the lowest number that we can possi that we that we generally offer, um, is **. Um, I would want to give you the lowest possible number realistically considering how I can see how many cases have been opened. S Yeah Uh huh. It Um, you know, for how many times things have gone down in voter faults and communication issues and things like that. So I mean, I, I, I, I can see kind of the issues that have, that have transpired prior to now. Um, was that something, was that number something that you? Oh Yeah. Jack mentioned ** to me. OK, that's even better. Yeah, no, Jackman **, mhm. And that's why I said yeah, I was, I would wanna hold the conversation with him just in case you guys talked about something a little bit more so OK, not a problem. He didn't actually leave a note in here at all, but I wanna see if. Yeah, yeah, we. Let's see, I see that he, you know, he did go ahead and leave something on the **st and that you spoke to him in regards to the EOL options, um, as well as kind of some removal reinstalls and, and things like that. So, OK, not a problem. With that said, did you know specifically when you wanted to have the panels removed because those two things can actually kind of coincide. Yeah. Sure, so yeah, the new roof is gonna be put on, put in on May *th. Makes sense. Got you. And so just did you just need them off anytime before then? Prior to that. OK Well, the, the roofers are coming on May *th. Gotcha, gotcha. OK. So yeah. Just some time. OK, sounds good. So, in which case, go ahead. And then yeah. No, go ahead. I was gonna say I'm not sure if it was something that he explained to you, but a lot of the time, if in the event you decide to renew, we can actually, uh, kind of waive the, the removal fee. So that, I mean, that's something that, that could certainly kind of make things make a little bit, you know, make a little bit more sense in this case. Um, so, OK, not a problem. He didn't leave a note in here. Correct. Yeah, yeah, he mentioned he mentioned that too. Great, great. OK, cool. So he didn't even a note in here as far as the, the $** but I'll take your word for it. I'll go ahead and leave the note in here, um, basically just saying that we'll get you down for $** for * years, um, and then what'll happen is they're gonna create what's called a lease transfer case, even though you're not transferring the lease, it's gonna go to our lease transfer team because they're gonna want to draw up a brand new contract for you. So what will happen is over the next couple of days, maybe weeks, it just kind of depends on, on how long it takes everything in the process. Hey Yeah OK. Um, what they'll do is they'll draw up a lease extension and then they'll send everything over to you. It'll, it'll basically be identical to what you signed off on originally. The difference is that it'll, of course, say * years at $** as opposed to, you know, the, the original contract. Um, once that's signed, that is pretty much immediately sent over to our document control team. They verify and then once we get the new service contract built for you, then you'll get the email saying that everything is up and running with the, with the new contract. OK. And OK. OK OK. Mhm. OK, and then you can go ahead and schedule the removal at zero cost to us, um, and then put back on at zero cost so we can go ahead and get that scheduled as well. All right. Uh Yep, and I was gonna say, and what I'll do for you right now, I'll go ahead and open up that case to our move reinstall team, um, because I know, of course I'm, I'm so glad that you called a month early because you run into so many issues where it's so close to the time in which you need the work done. It puts us in a bit of a, of a shuffle, um, so what I can do is send over to our move. Right, right, that's why I, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm so, so glad you made my job so much easier, but um I just wanna let them know. OK great. Well, I'm glad I made it easier for you, Christian. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, um, so what I'll do, I can't of course schedule here because I don't have the ability to kind of put it in. I'm not sure how busy the techs are, but, um, because you let us know so early, it gives us a, a, a nice kind of, kind of, kind of cushion. So I'm gonna send everything over to our move reinstall team, um, the case that's already open. Let them. you know that you are gonna have to remove that at no cost. I'll go ahead and leave the note here saying that you decided to renew, um, so that it's at no cost to you. And then what'll happen is they'll shoot you a text probably in the next couple of days or so, maybe sooner than that, but certainly within the next couple of days or so, uh, just to confirm the date and time that we have you down for for the removal. OK. OK. OK. Now, I do want to And you were saying removed at no cost, but they're gonna put back, they're gonna be put back in at no cost too, right, Christian? Yes, that's correct. Yes, remove and reinstall. I apologize. OK. Yeah, yeah, removal and reinstall at no cost. Um, and then what'll happen is, like I said, they're gonna shoot you that text. I do wanna let you know though that the text is not something that you can reply to, so it'll be to confirm the date. Um, if you don't say anything at all, it'll just, you know, it'll automatically confirm, um, if any that you do have an issue with that with whatever the date is, give us a call to let us know because if you can shoot a text back to it, it won't actually deliver. OK. Got you. OK. Got you. All right. So I will put that in here. Give me one second. Can you update her phone number too, Christian? I wanna put my husband's number on there because I, I, I can't always answer my phone at work. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. One second here. Christian, there was also something um Jack put in about like our solar panels are not working up to par. Um and yeah, I think he was putting something in to have somebody come look at them as well. Yeah. Mhm. Alright. Or test them or there was something else he put in. Let's see. Yeah, OK, yes, so it looks like the, the note that he left in here, um, and I'm glad because it, it coincides directly with what I'm doing right now, but what he put in for is for a diagnostic to be run, um, before the removal reinstall process begins. So I opened up the case just now for you for, uh, the removal reinstall to actually take place. What. Right. OK great. Happen is because he put that in for you instead of them jumping directly to, to scheduling, it'll go to our diagnostic team first, and then they'll do, they'll run the tests, figure out specifically what's going on with it, and then what'll happen is they'll, of course, address what's what's actually happening that way by the time we put them back on, we can have the problem solved then as well. Got it. That sounds great. And the diagnosis, is that something you just do like from your location or is that somebody comes out? What does that look like? OK. Yeah, yes. So it's, it's both, it's both. So the diagnostic begins remotely. Um, they'll, of course, kind of sit behind the computers and do what they do. Um, but basically what it is, it's kind of a scan from every single piece of your solar system, uh, from the panels, the, the, the strings, the inverter, micro inverter, optimizer, everything, reporting device, etc. batteries, um, and basically determined they make sure that everything is working at, at kind of optimal capability. If it's not. OK. OK. And of course, they deeper dive, figure out what's causing that. And then once they come up with that conclusion, they send that directly over to our scheduling team or our field technicians, they come out and troubleshoot it in person. So what will happen is they'll kind of come up with their diagnostic, send it to them reinstall team, we reinstall send their texts out, they'll remove and then when we come back to right before we come back to reinstall, they'll fix the problem and then put the, the, the corrected panels back on your. OK. Got you. That sounds good. All right. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, you're very helpful. All right. So that is done and sent over to remove reinstall. And then you said you wanted to update the phone number, is that right? Yes, please. OK, got you. All right. So right now I have ***-******* as the primary and not the same number as the secondary. Did you want to make this new number primary or secondary? Yes. Make the name of a primary please and it's ***. Tom, OK. Yeah ***. **** **** got you ******-****? OK. Yes, sir. Got you. All right, so that is done and that is updated for you. So the removal reinstall case is open. Um, I did go ahead and leave the note in saying that everything was gonna be waived. Uh, that's immediately sent off to diagnostics. Like I said, once diagnostic does their thing, it'll go to scheduling, and then we'll shoot you a text with the date we have in mind. Like I said, if it doesn't work, just give us a call, let us know it doesn't work, and we can try to come up with a date that makes better sense for you. Sounds good. So we should be getting a text or an email about the contract renew. Then we have these two cases open so that should cover everything, right? Yeah, that's it. So the lease transfer case is is already opened by him. Um, that case, like I said, they're gonna draw up a new contract for you with all the, the kind of renewed terms. You should get an emails sometime soon, um. With that new contract on there, you'll probably get a call to go with it, honestly, so that they can, we can kind of go over everything with you, answer any final questions, kind of go over everything you can expect, um, and that's typically sent via DocuSign so you just kind of click, you know, sign off on it comes back to us. Once that's done, it immediately goes off for approval and then in the background, of course, we'll start working on getting that removal reinst all done, um, as well as the diagnostic that he has opens up. OK. OK. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sounds great. All right. Is there anything else I can help with? No thank you so much. You've had you've answered all my questions. All right. And I'll go ahead and, and let Jack know exactly what's going on. That way if there's anything else that he wants to communicate with you, he can go ahead and give you a call and has kind of all the updated information. That sounds great thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. You have a good one.

Um, let's see. Yeah, I understand that. I So I should, I should say I should see on my utility bill. Um, some sort of. Record of of uh activity. Correct. Sometimes CMP is really weird in that they use both unilateral and uh. What's the word I'm looking for? Unilateral and bilateral meters. Um, if they installed a unilateral meter, you won't see a notation on your bill as to what your usage was using and selling. OK. Um, if they installed a bilateral, they'll they'll list it differently. Uh, give me one second. OK. Sorry for that wait. I was trying to see if I can pull up monitoring on the system. Sure. I um How would I know if it's a buy that or? Uh, it's completely dependent on if they put it on the bill or not. Um, I cannot pull monitoring on the system, so they haven't handed that over to us either. So this electricity that I'm producing, where is it going? Just into the grid. As far as I know, there is no electricity being produced. The system might be on, but it could be in what's called standby mode, which is where um it only runs itself, or it only runs its own like internal system. It doesn't actually produce full power. OK. Mhm Um, it could be that the systems on. It shows that the Tesla. The Tesla app shows kilowatt hours generated. OK, yeah, if you're seeing production coming from your test lab, then CMP should be seeing that power and you should be getting reduced bills from CMP. OK. Yeah. Yeah, the um But you still need paperwork from ventures so. Yep, as far as we're aware, the system isn't on, so we aren't going to charge you. Uh, when we do get all the paperwork from Venture Solar, uh, the first month that we bill you will be the first month, uh, we aren't gonna back charge for these past couple of months.

Yeah there's nothing that you need to do on your end um it's up to Venture or solar to do what they're supposed to do so we can properly monitor maintain. OK. Uh, and show the system. OK Um, hopefully they get everything over to us so there's no uh issues with the maintenance and monitoring side of things. Uh, if you know if the system go down, uh, just give us a call, uh, that way we can create the work order anyways even if we can't actually see it. OK, very good. So we should call you Yes, if you have questions, concerns, anything like that, give us a call and not venture Solar. OK. So that's why they have the guy who was in the office.

Let's see, as far as the underperformance case that's open, um, it looks like they're, they're actually in the process now of finishing up the diagnostic, um, and it looks like then of course the next step will be to assign the technicians. uh, did you have a specific date in which you'd like us out because that might help kind of push things forward a little bit faster. OK, well, here's the deal. I'm paying ** months and I'm not paying a penny more until. The service is operational. Mhm. So you can inform the. Uh, collections person to stop calling me because I'm not gonna pay a penny more because I paid ** months now. And not have any services. Got you. OK.

Push things along a little bit faster because they do get notified every time, you know, a new a new notice left in the case so that help, that should help kind of get things going. Did you have a, uh, a specific date in mind? I can let I can let them know because sometimes that's a little bit easier to, to kind of get it scheduled if they have a date that they're aiming for. Uh, I, I'm waiting on them. They said that they were going to notify or contact Taco. Mhm. Uh, because according to the, uh, field inspector Crico. The It was not installed correctly and they would not activate it or allow. Got you. Charges, I mean, allow me to uh uh. Uh, reap the benefits. Got you, got you, OK. So, uh, again, uh.

Like I said, I'll, um, I, I'll definitely take heed, uh, and let your, your billing manager know exactly what's what's going on and, and like I said, leave a note here in the case for our diagnostics team and our operations team so we can try to get things going for you. Uh, in the meantime, I just wanna verify that number, the number that you called from, that's still a good number to contact you on, is that correct? Right ***-****. OK. OK, alright, sounds good. That's what we have on file, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna go ahead and, and, and leave that note with them that way if and when that time does come for we can skip the process of them reaching out to us by the time they reach out to us, you know, we have to reach out to you. We can, it can delay things a good bit. So I wanna make sure that the schedulers and our operations team have your number directly that way you can be in direct, you know, kind of communication with them.

Right, so your payment automatically comes out on the **th. Why, why am I getting a bill? But I get a bill every month or I get a sheet every month that says I got to pay by a certain time. It doesn't say anything about here that I'm on auto payment. It says they expect the check, you know, but within a certain date. My total is due so much and I gotta pay. How how come I'm still getting that? Shouldn't it just say somewhere uh you were on auto payment or something like that? Yeah. No, it's not. It's just gonna show the payment in parenthesis to show that um that you paid because if you look on the, on your payment. On your invoice it has **** in parentheses. That's what they received. Yeah. So your payment for. There's due date, well, last thing I, I should. But it doesn't say anywhere that I already made the, well, it doesn't say that I made an auto payment.

So, my name is Terry Ezel, and I've been trying to speak with someone on the line keeps cutting me off. Oh no. If we, if we get disconnected, I promise to call you back. So my number is ***. I've got a ***-***-****, is that right? OK, so I'm calling about. ** That's it. OK. OK, so I'm calling to find out what's going on with my system. Um, I called on the *rd because it wasn't working. And had not been for a week. And * days later, it started working, which is great, but this has happened like every month. And I need to know why and what's wrong with it. Right. I see that there's a case open for inverter fault so it means that there's an issue with the inverter which is basically the. The uh hold on, verified system showing zero generation and solar so inverters showing an error and basically that's the one that converts the solar energy into energy that your home can use and so just to confirm, Miss Terry, this is for [REDACTED], right? Baton Rouge? Yes. Yes, ma'am, it is. And I just had the inverter replaced, um, that's a new one. It was ordered on **:**, um, so it's, it's been recent. Alright perfect so. Mhm. Yeah, and this one is noted on **, so they just created a task to have it replaced and, and even though it's new it could potentially be faulty. I'm not sure I'm not a technician. I'm just reading here as I see the information. So Ms. Terry, they have a request for a technician to go out, but I don't see that it's been assigned or scheduled yet. So the next step is for them to call you because I show that this was set up on the *th, so basically * days ago. OK, so how long does that normally take for somebody to get in touch with me? I'm not sure, to be honest, that would be at the availability of the scheduling team. I know that when it comes for scheduling removals and reinstalls, it's about * weeks, but when it comes to equipment failure, I would anticipate it to be sooner, but I honestly, I don't, I don't know, Ms. Terry, that's outside of my realm. I, I work in the customer service. I don't see the scheduling. I'm so sorry. OK. OK, so can you put me in touch with someone that can tell me if my having a equipment failure, which is what I'm having. Mhm. When can I expect somebody to get in touch with me? Alright, let me ask, I mean this is not the *st time, it's not the *nd time, it's multiple times and, and I'm a bit frustrated. Sure. I understand completely.

Reach out to one of these managers I've sent him a message and I'm just not getting a response right now. So I can, I can leave you on hold or I can call you back as soon as I get an answer.

I was calling because you have a past due amount on your account of $** on your solar panel system. I'm trying to say, I'm tired of this, not with y'all with this. Y'all call me every other week about something and I'm not understanding why like I just got I just got the two text messages today. I ignored it because I just talked to somebody like a week and a half ago and take payments about something. I'm not understanding why every other week I'm being charged and I'm saying I'm being late. How? I thought it was a monthly thing. It is a monthly thing, but it looks like you, you just have a past due amount for, um, it looks like for March and April of $**. How? You just call, you just call me and say whatever was passed with the, I'm gonna have to look at this stuff. I'm, I don't want to pay right now cause I have to look at it. I've just been paying every time somebody called me like it's not on a, on a monthly thing and how every month I'm late. I that't make sense. I just don't make sense. Well, it's not a late, it's not actually a late charge. It's just your payment. They didn't charge you a late fee. They're saying that you owe $**. Yeah, so I'm trying to, I'm if I'm paying on time, how am I getting late fees for late fees? So that's what I'm saying. I might have to look at it and see what's going on because I don't right now I'm just paying and just listening to what y'all are telling me. But if I have * systems and we were supposed to have it all on one to avoid this, like I've been dealing with this now you wanna say I went on a field trip with my daughter last year and I thought I was done with this. Now it's January, February, March, now April the same stuff. Right. Yes, ma'am. I didn't know it was gonna be difficult. I didn't. I would have not worried about it. I'm just paying for something and I don't even know how it was going. OK. Yes, ma'am. So I just wanted to call you. Can you verify the address on your account really quick? [REDACTED]. OK.

So I was just calling to let you know. Yeah, let me, I'm gonna look at it to see because I don't know how it went from that to $*** and something dollars just out the blue and late and stuff like I don't know, but thank you, yeah, I'm gonna look into it. OK. Well it looks like It looks like you're on a promo for a ****. Yeah, I know, I know we talked about the promo that's what I'm saying after I understood all of that, we're still having issues and that's the part I'm not understanding. So I understand about the promos and they're going out and all of that, but again, like I'm saying before the promos were out, I was getting late fees and charges and why? So that's what I'm not getting. I just don't have time to look into it at this very moment, but I will because I have to figure out why is all this going on. I don't want late fees if I don't need to be for nothing, you know, so I need to figure out what's going on. Mhm. Right. Well, Well, when you pay after the **th, you're gonna get a late fee and I see a lot of your charges that you paid, or payments that you made, you made past the **th. me pass the And I had everything on one day, so that's again is on you guys. I had everything. I had everything on one thing and there were * different systems. I had someone look into it and we wouldn't have had the problems anymore. That's what y'all say when the calls be recorded, but I still have the issues, so that's what I'm saying. Mhm. Yeah, this is on system * that I'm calling about system *.

OK, so the system one looks like you don't have any past due amount. You pay it up on that one. It's just System * it looks like. I don't even see you have a System *. You said you had a systems *? Yes ma'am. I'm not even pulling up a systems *. I see * and *. Yeah, so see that's another thing.

No, no, I understand, but I do have to call you about trying to collect the payment from you. Yes. So do you think I can OK, once I had everything. Do you want me to give you a call back, say Friday and check with you to see about making a payment? Yes. Yeah, I'm gonna make the payment, but I need to understand what I'm paying for first, like, so that's what I'm saying you just call me out of out off guard, and I'm just not in it right now, so I just don't wanna pay and I'm not understanding what I'm paying for because like I said I just got a call about two weeks ago saying that my auto pay is not going through. I don't know, but it's just too much information right now. OK. Mhm. Yeah, you're not on a spot. You're not on auto pay. So I'm going to um Friday whenever you call me back I'll be I'll have time to look into it and see about how many systems I have, if it's on a promo, if it's off and when I'm gonna be making the payment on the system. Mhm. Right. Yeah, I do see that you are on a promo. The promo ended in March, and now you're on your regular payment. Starting in April April *st. You're on regular payment. I. So March you had the promo and April you got regular payment. OK. OK. I'm just looking at your payment schedule, so I do see where probably the confusion is coming in because the promo was only for * months. Mhm. So, In recent years, so in this in Now it's the regular payment. That's where the $** is coming in at. Yeah OK. OK, but I'll give you a call back Friday.

Um, you came out to my home, I don't know, maybe about a year ago, almost a year ago, but for some reason you didn't complete the job, and I guess my question. Mhm. I'm wondering as to why, you know. You all didn't complete, you know, the job. OK, I can look into that for you. What's the name, address and phone number on your account? The phone number ***-***-****. The name is um. I don't know, it could be Linda and Lance Well Lawrence. OK, and what about the email? M I S S L A T N E Y *@msn.com. Thank you. Oh No. OK, so it looks like. Oh There was something to do with the production requirements. It was below the minimum. There's a certain threshold you have to have. With the In order for the the for it to make sense to use solar. So if you don't use enough electricity, it, it, we can't save you any money, you would be spending more money. Mhm. Well, if I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm paying like $*** something dollars, that's not enough. I can resubmit it and see what they say. OK, because that just makes sense to me that, um, I'm paying $*** something dollars. A month. Mhm. So, you know, I don't understand what they mean. I'm not using them enough. Well, it's, it's the amount of electricity, not necessarily the dollar amount that you're paying, and they look at the amount of electricity that you're using. Versus you, they have to factor in and make sure that you can save money. We don't want you to just pay for solar and you're still paying and not saving anything. So I can let them let the sales person know and have them look into this again for you with the design team. And see what they come up with for you. OK, OK, alright then, because it doesn't make any sense to me. So alright, do that. How long will that take? OK. I, I'm not exactly sure this has to go back through some channels. To see what they can rework. And find out it it does have to go in line with everyone else who is submitting requests. Mhm mhm So I would say give it at least ** days, at least. Mhm Oh wow. That's a long time. I mean, the normal process for solar takes about * months. OK. So we've done most of it as far as you know looking at your home and things of that nature but we do have to submit this and get it, get a design approved. So that's where they are they need to get a design approved if it's feasible, it has to be feasible, it has to make sense for you to pay for solar. So I will let So otherwise you're saying it's not designed. Design, um, Because they did, they came to my home, they went over, looked at the roof, and they did all of that stuff. Mhm. Right, but then it goes to the next set in the next part where the design team has to look at what you're requesting and see if it makes sense for you to have that that system will it save you money because our contract states that you will have a production guarantee and there will be some form of savings in that first year if it's not going to save you, we're not gonna have you sign up because that's not the contract. Mhm. So it hasn't gotten to that to that stage as of yet, is that what you're saying? So It hasn't gotten to any other stages. It's, it halted there. So I will find your sales person and have them look at this again with the design team. OK. Let me ask OK then let me ask you to see it. Mhm. If it's at that, if it's at that stage, what was their decision? Why they stopped there. Right, because it, it wasn't the, the design wasn't going to save you anything. Well I wasn't gonna save any money. Right. So that's why they're they're they asked them to resubmit it. Hm. So I'm gonna ask what's going on with this why it hasn't been resubmitted is it is it feasible if it's not feasible, I need to know that so. You can know. Mhm mhm. OK. OK then. All right, you can do that. All right, did you have any other questions? Yes. Uh, no. Um. No, now how would I know? I mean, how would you let me know is that uh you're gonna, you would call me or you would, um. Send something out. All right. You will get a call and more than likely an email. OK then. All right.

Yeah, this is uh Coopogen. How can I help you today? Well, that's uh OK you are a part of the Solar Solution, right? Uh, yeah, I work for, I work for Postage and Solar. Hello? I say if you are well you are um OK you make the billing but who's in charge on the on the on the company solar solutions. Uh, are you asking who did your install? I'm sorry, OK, if I need, and if I, if I need, oh, OK, if I need to, to, if I need to, yeah, I need the service from you guys with who I have to speak for. You're asking who installed the system? Uh, that'd be us. Can you confirm the address for me? Sure. *:**. Myrtle Street, Elizabeth, New Jersey. OK. And yeah, what's, what's going on with the system? OK. Uh, I, I, well, if you're able to help me, thank you. If not you have to transfer someone who can help me. This is my second. Well, I called last last month and I call back again and I said please, I have, I have * m which is involved with uh solar panels. But I don't know which one, which one it is, which one is which one is house, which one is *st floor, which one is *nd floor, which you know which one is *rd floor. And I told them upgrade and put the apartments, but they, they, they didn't receiving the bills you already charged me but I don't know which one it is. OK, so you're saying you don't know what meter the panels are connected to, is that what you're saying? Correct. Which, uh, every bill, every bill which you guys send me, I don't know which, which, which floor it is. OK. And how many That is why I say if you have the accounts on I have I have *. Yeah, so you have, you have * m. Do you also have * solar systems? Yes. OK. And I have * different accounts which they're not specific specify. Which which one is *st floor or *nd or *rd or house? Got you. Yeah, I don't think we have it specified on our end at all. It just says, like, we just have your address. So like they all just say uh *** or [REDACTED]. No, that They should be happy because the No, no, no, they should be have because remember they, they, I have rented that, that, that place. I'm not, I'm not leaving, I'm, I'm gonna leave my law alone on all three floors, no, I rent the *st and *nd, so you should be sending that one and that way that I have to give the tenants. OK. Oh no, uh oh, I'm wrong. I'm just pulling all * of them up right now. Just give me a sec. Thank you. OK, I see where they're labeled now. We have floor ***, house and floor *. Correct. But you're saying when you get the bill in, you can't tell which one's which is that what you're saying? Nothing exactly. OK, let me go look at one of the bills. And also I told them upgrade, upgrade my last name. And also they didn't do that. They put my second last name and they didn't put my first last name, which is Christoval Leanevski. I see, I see your name on your account as uh Cristobal Yamasque Ron. OK, so why they didn't send right here? They send in the bill. Christova wrong. So. Um All right, so yeah, I do see on the bill doesn't show that. So what I can do is, um, I can give you which account numbers go to which one if you want to maybe write down which one is which. But, No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want that. I remember I have to give it to the tenants. I don't have to be called every month or I have to write it. No, they have to come from you guys from you guys have to come floor * floor *. How on floor * I don't care because I live on floor *. Hm. But floor * floor *, they have to be with you guys but they made them be on. I don't have, I don't have to write in every month, no. So what, what I'm, so we can't change the bill to section, right? Like that has to have the address, so we can't like add in a floor there. It has to have the exact shipping address for the bill too. Uh, it's like a like a legal thing, um, but I can tell you which account numbers go to which one, but we can't edit the bill to section. That's what you're asking me to do. No, no, no. You should be upgrade definitely yes, someone has to upgrade and otherwise it's very easy for me. I said I, I, I can stop the service that's all, and, and send the company to remove the panels and I'm, I'm happy and I keep it with PSNG and done. They don't have no problem to upgrade the the the floors. This is not, it's no big deal to upgrade just to writing the floor is upgrade. OK. Uh, like I said, I mean, I. It's, it's very simple. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. Um, I can ask, but I don't think they're gonna add that into the bill to section, because it's like a, a shipping address, uh, thing. I'm Um, I mean, I can, I can ask him though, but that's not. Yeah, but the shipping address is one. Yeah. OK, OK. Yeah, um, so I can, I can ask them to see if they'll do that, but I don't know if they're gonna change that. They should be because the number, it's not *, it's not * level, it's not * m, it's * m. I understand that. It's * units. Yeah, it's * units. They can't send you with a deliberate address, no way. The deliberate address it is with one, but it's not single family. It's * families. I is it different mailing addresses to each one of those? So it's No, it's not different. It's not different, but it's three-family house. But it's one mailing address. And have * m. They have *, yeah, and they and they have * accounts, * different accounts. I understand what you're saying. That's what I have to make sense, yeah, so. Right, I, I do understand what you're saying. There's * m and * accounts to utility company, but I'm asking you is, is there only one mailing address or do each of those? OK. Floors have different mailing addresses. No, because it's in the same building. Right, so this bill. This is the mailing address that's listed here, right? So, that's what I'm saying. I'm not sure if they can add that in, because this is a mailing address. No, but I, I, I, I understand what, uh, no, so this, I need someone we, we can talk very, uh, OK, clear, and he, they have to fix it and also I have a problem with the house, with house, uh, panels as well, so I need to be fix it this month because we already pay double which I haven't been paid yet. And, and, and someone has to, you, you have to trust me with someone who can help me that or otherwise I have to, I have to tell them so come and remove the thing that's all, and I say and I say to button you every month. Mhm Yes, sir. So there's nobody I can transfer you to, you know, I am, I'm talking to you now and and and trying to help you out. Like I said, I'll see if they can add that in, but as from my understanding, this is the mailing address. So if there's only one mailing address, I don't think they're gonna change that to list what floors on, but I will ask and see if it can be changed. OK, OK, it's one mirror red again, but yeah, it's, it's different floors. It's not, it's not one account, it's * accounts. I understand, which is why they each have their own unique account number, right? But the bill that's being mailed there has the same mailing address, but they all have different account numbers, which is why I was going, you know, offering to tell you which account numbers are for which floor. OK, uh, Right. Yeah. It OK, let's OK, let me, let me just ask, let me just tell you. There's *, there are * family house. I have the cats, the Elizabeth. Natural gas. I have it. All three floors is in my name. Bad. They came. Elizabeth Gas, *nd floor. Elizabeth Gas, *st floor. Elizabeth Gas, *rd floor was my name and the same email address. OK. Yeah, that I say how it look like if you not send me an email and I and I send you the gas bills. And you can see, but I say it's very simple, it's very simple just to clarify that's all. Again. Right, and, and again, I do understand what you're asking me. I do understand that. I'm just saying uh us as a company at Fosagegen, typically they don't edit that. And again, like I said, I will ask and see if I can get that edited for you, but I just don't know if they will, right? So I will see if I can get that edited. OK, so OK, so we, we have. With who to to have to talk to them, so would I have to talk with the solar solution? Is there any the the the company is solar solution? No, sir, you're talking to the right person right here. You don't need to talk to anybody else. I'm gonna see if we can get that adjusted for you. OK. OK. And so now, uh, OK, you're gonna, OK, you're gonna see if you can help me with, if not, so I have to call again back next month when I receive another bill. With the same issues, but they're not gonna call to say fix it and I'm gonna call to say set up the appointment. Come by and remove the panels. And that's it. I understand what you're saying. Again, I will see what I can do on my end to get this resolved the way you would like. Um, I don't know if they will or not. I will definitely let you know what I find out either way though. So give me a little bit. Let me look into this for you, and I'll see if we can get that added or adjust it. OK. Oh, OK. You wanna see now? you want me to wait now, or? No, don't wait right now because I don't know how long it's gonna take me to get an answer. I'm just letting you know that I'm gonna look into this for you and I will let you know what I find out. OK. OK, how are you gonna let me know by phone call, email? Yes, sir. I'll give you a call back to the number we have on file, the ***-***-****. OK, OK, so now, now, uh. What I see In the house and the house meeting. Well it's in the house meter. They help me to Is nothing changed, nothing changed. I haven't been paid. The bill which you guys sent me and. With the PS and she sent me, which actually haven't been paid before. They actually The actual bill. So in my understanding is something is wrong which is not generating any energy from that meter who. Who has to who who has to take a look and make sure it's the generator or how you gonna do that. Yeah. Take a look now. So the house system specifically, so whenever you look at the electric bill for the house system, you're not seeing any solar generation, is that correct? I don't, I don't see changes because look, and help meter can tell you, OK, I see changes. OK, and the health meter what I see we use the less kilowatts and I pay the same bill as before. Plus, plus. The the solar solution. OK. Specifically, what I'm asking you is, on the utility bill for the house, do you see any credits for the solar being sold back to the utility company? No, I don't see anything. OK. What I see, what I see, what I, what I see, what I see, what I see changes, it is in all floors, which is *st, *nd and *rd. My floor has to be higher because I use. But I'm not a household. OK. But so, specifically, on the other * floors, when you look at the utility bill for those * floors. You're seeing solar generation on them, but on the house floor you're not, is that correct? I just. You have the OK, uh, Hello. Hello? Hi, I'm here. OK, I'm not hearing you that way, OK. Look, I'm gonna tell you something right here, look. You're gonna send me something you said? Yeah, I'm gonna tell you, look, and the house and the house of meter, dude, and the house of meter. I haven't been using this month. *** kilowatts out that is the house needed. OK. And I have the bill where I have to pay you guys I think it's about ** or something. Plus, ****, which you haven't been paid before. The meeting with with you guys has been has been an activity. That was the same deal. For $**. Now, No, in *rd floor, I use ***. Kilowatts. Which I pay you guys and I pay to PSNG about $* that make sense. You see the difference? OK. But what I'm asking you. I use Do I understand, but what I'm asking you specifically is, do you see credits or any generation from the solar system on those bills? Yeah. Where, where we can see the, the, the, the, the, OK, I don't have any credits. On either one of the bills. You don't see any credits, you don't see any solar sellback or any, anything at all from the solar system on either bills. From from solar no nothing. Oh, none of those. Any credits for solarenses. And any of those, I have a credit. I have a credit in the first floor, but it's not for the solar. It is for my, for my deposit when I open the account. OK, yeah, I'm not, yeah, not, not really asking about that. I'm asking specifically on those bills you can see. That's all. Any energy from the solar system. It should be labeled as like. You know, kilowatt hours from customer to grid. Actually, what's, what's your electric company? Um, PS N G. No. Hold on. Good All right. So when you look at your bill, do you see two sections, one for total kilowatt hours in and one for total kilowatt hours out? Give me a second. What, what is this one? I, I have, I'm, I'm OK. I'm, I'm with the, I'm on the *rd floor, OK. The ***, OK, what, what, when I see the two sections you said. Yeah, under the uh under the details of your electric charges page. Do you see a number for total kilowatt hours in, and a number for total kilowatt hours out? OK, total kill in, yes, ***. And this is for the *rd floor bill? OK. I'm on the *rd floor Bill, yes. OK. And what about kilowatt hours out? ********. Is it, is it *** or ***? No, ***. What's the exact number, ***? Yeah, *** yes. OK, and then what about for the house? OK, the house. The houses Uh, total covered in ***. And out is ***. Right, so the reason the house bill, so just, just so we're clear, kilowatt hours out, that is your solar that you're selling back, right? So both of those bills show kilowatt hours out. So both of those bills show solar. The difference is the *rd floor has more solar sell back, so we got a larger credit. Then the House did. So that's why the *rd floor bill is lower than the House bill. Mm. Right. OK, OK, so yeah, now I understand now. OK, so that means the total kilow in is from where? From the utility company to you. From, uh, from, um. From PSNG from my company, right? Yes, sir. Yes, and, and, and, and, and total, OK, and total clue what's out is from Soliana. Yes, but it's only the extra solar that you didn't use, right? So it's whatever you didn't use that you sold back to them. That that is a well ******, let's say with a house *** less ***, so that's with the risk. Uh, OK. Uh, does that make sense? Well, uh, I, uh, yeah, I try doing the same now, OK. So that means, that means, that means the, the, the house, the house meat is not gonna work properly then. That's not what that means. It just means that, so the numbers are gonna be different based on how much usage you have and how much solar production you have for each one of the meters. So they're not gonna be the same numbers and that's OK. It just means that on this particular billing cycle, You sold more power back on the *rd floor than you did in the house, so it just means that you use more power on the house meter than you did on the *rd floor meter. Right, that's OK. That's what makes us fine, yeah. It does, it doesn't mean they're not working though. That's, yeah, that's, that's my surprise because in the house we use the less because it's used for the hallways and the garage. And the bill come with higher and everyone. OK. Are, are all * systems the same size? No, no, no, no, the, the, the, the house, no, the, the, the, the bigger size, it is *rd floor, and then is another, then another one is the *nd. First order less and the houses less actually. I, I'm not sure if the the houses. Well that would make sense then if the house, the house of the smallest solar system is going to have the smallest amount of solar power produced. * panels of Right, so these bills. But that was, yeah. These bills are both showing solar credits, so they are working correctly. Sure. So the, the, the house, the house bill is not gonna work with me then. I said because last year I haven't been paying. The bill would I pay actually to PNG now so if I pay to PNG. The same bill what haven't been paid before. Plus the $** what I pay for for the uh for the solar panel for the solar solar solution, so I mean I pay twice. Which is not gonna be helping me. They're not gonna help for the housing. OK. I mean, you gotta understand too though, if the, the house system, if the health system is the smallest system, right, it's, it's gonna have the smallest impact on the bill, right? You also got to remember, this is the winter time. This is the lowest time of the year for system production, right? We do guarantee that you'll have savings, but that's on the first year, not just the first couple of months. So we, we have to see what what we can do. Right, so OK. As of right now, what I can see is that it is working. It's online, it's working. You have credits showing up on your bill, which means you're selling back to the utility company. That Right. Oh yes, that I see the difference that I said I see the difference and and and actually and, and all three I see the difference. Just in the house, which is I don't, I don't see difference. Right, but the, the house is the smallest system, right? So it's gonna be the smallest amount of difference. That one is more. OK, so I, I was seeing the, what we wanna, we wanna see, we, OK, so with that we OK and we're gonna see the because that we have to fix that thing we have to put the floor by floor because I have a tenant. I have rent and I have to give them. Yeah. I understand that. um, like I said, I'll, I'll see what I can do on that, but you got to give me a little bit of time to look into it. So I don't have an answer for you right this second, but give me a little bit of time to look into it and I'll see if we can, if we can do anything with that. Thank you. OK. OK, thank you very much. Sure, not a problem. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No, that's all, that's all what I need to fix that. thank you. Got you. All right, thanks for calling.

And um I have a problem with my, my um my panels on my house, they're not even on and it's been some, it's it's gotta be some months that it hasn't been on, and I haven't heard from anybody about it not being on y'all would know that, right? Yeah, we should be able to pull up the monitoring. Give me * *nd to try and pull up the account. Right, so My address is um is in Roslin Raleigh. The address is [REDACTED]. That's in Harvey, Louisiana *****. Alright, I see the account. One second while I grab the monitoring ID and pull it up. I see no lights on it and no lights been on it for some weeks now, man. My bill, my, my bill is like kind of skyrocketed, dude. Alright, I see that the reporting on the system. It is fine. We're still seeing production on our side. Sounds to me like the inverter, uh, diagnostic lights might be going out. That usually happens with, um, depending on where they are, could be that got some bleached. Um, I can open up a case with diagnostics just in case they have better access than we do for like logging into the inverter and seeing what's going on. Yeah. So give me one moment, let me open up a case so that they can double check, make sure the numbers that I see are what's actually um being outputted by the system. Mhm. Mhm. I have never had those panels cleaned since I've had them. Is that possible to get that done or I'm gonna have to do it myself? Unfortunately we no longer have any cleaning crews. We haven't had any cleaning crews since ****. Uh, they left us once the jobs from after IA dried up. Uh, we had a reduced number of cleaning jobs after IDA. And so they they were subcontractors before, so unfortunately we can't offer cleaning at this time. Um, if you'd like to get cleaning done yourself, um, either yourself or somebody else willing to get on the roof, all you need is like a, a simple soap and water, uh, not a pressure wash or anything, just like a, a hose or a hose with a nozzle on it. Mhm And then simple soap could be Dawn dish soap or anything that you would use on your car. That top layer of the panels is glass, so just nothing with like particles in it, nothing abrasive, stuff like that. Uh, you don't need fancy chemicals. Mm. Yeah So I couldn't like use a mop. I couldn't use a mop or a handle, a brush handle or something like that. Like a, a scrub brush, one that you would use to scrub your car. Yes. Yep, you can use that. Uh, you don't need anything fancy. OK. Um, Dawn dishwash deliver. Yeah, you shouldn't need a cleaning because your system is outputting slightly above expectations. They might have some grime and dust on them, but whatever is on them isn't enough to be affecting production. Uh, let me compare your production right now to last year. Mhm. Let's see. Mhm hm your system does usually perform. But better. ***.*. I haven't been getting any man I've been paying really high on my bill, man, and I don't do a lot of it, you know. It's like, I don't get any, like I, I don't see any. Any, any, um. Work where they've been helping me out through energy uh through the solar panels, man. It's just like the same dam. Like my solar panels ain't doing anything. When I first got them, my bill was like $**.** dollars a month. Shit. Have you changed anything with your usage in the home? Because it's not like you have a small system you've been outputting between *** to *** kilowatts each month. You did get a little bit less over the winter, uh, between * to *** versus the usual * to *. No. But that's still a good chunk to be getting on the bill. Um, do you have a bill on hand? Uh, no, I don't right now. Alright, uh, when did you get the chance to look. Because I usually do more bills over the phone. Yeah, whenever you get the chance to look at one of the energy bills, I'll check the back of it. They should have meter readings on there. There should be two readings, one that says company KWH the customer and the other that says customer KWH company. The customer KWH the company is the portion of power that was produced during the day that you did not use, so I got told ent you for a credit on the bill. I Mhm. Mm Um, with the production in the ** to *** range, I would expect it to be selling back about *** kilowatts, maybe a little bit less depending on how much you use. The more your home uses, the less you're expected to sell back, but we don't really expect people to sell back zero unless their usage is above like **** kilowatts. Uh, closer to *** to ***, * to **** range, but if you're using less than ****, we would expect you to have to sell back on there. Mhm. Um, so we need to get the chance, I would check those statements, um, it would be the, the statement version of the bill, not like the app. Um, it would be where they break down the prices and it'll be on the, the back of the page where they list all the prices you'll find the meter readings. Mhm. OK. Um, in case you'd like to review it with one of us, just give us a call back. We're happy to review bill over the phone with you. Um, but yeah, just in case, I am opening up that diagnostics case with the diagnostics team so that they can double check, they can log into the inverter, make sure what's being outputted is what's actually being outputted and not like a misread. OK. OK. Yeah because I don't see any lights and nothing on anymore, man. You know, lights and nothing on, so it's not indicated to me that it's, it's working or not, you know. No lights is on, but it's on on position. Mhm, yeah, I'll put it in and put notes on the account saying that the inverter lights are gone so um they're gonna double check everything they'll log in and if needed they'll, uh, schedule an appointment with field services for someone to go out and swap out the light box. OK, so you gonna hook me up with the people right now, or? I'm creating a case with them. OK. Alright, we should be good to go, just finishing up opening this case. You need my email address? Nope, I got everything on the account. Mm. Alright, the case is open with them. They should be um taking a look and adjusting everything, um. Let's see if they do end up having to schedule someone to go out, you'll get a text message of that appointment date. Mhm. OK, and what number? Um, ***-***-****. Yes, that's. OK. All right, anything else I can help you with? I'll be waiting for that now. No, that's it man. I'll be waiting for him to call me. All right. Appreciate it thanks bye.

Hi Christopher how are you? I'm doing all right. How are you today? I'm pretty good. How can I help you today? Well, I am I had had several conversations with Cindy. I don't know if she's immediately available just to expedite things, but I had had my system go down. I'm I'm a relatively new customer, uh, just about * months or so, I think, and of those *, it was down for for. * months kind of unbeknownst to me because I don't have good dashboard visibility and, um, and then about a month ago I think the guys had come over and found out it was a fuse and replaced that and so it was supposed to be up and running um so two issues one, I don't know if it's up and running my the dashboard tool doesn't seem to show anything for. You know, um, You know, January, February, March, any production. Um, and then *, I was, I was paying that whole time for, you know, my bill for solar, um, even though I wasn't receiving solar, um, and I was also paying an electric bill, uh, for electricity I was receiving from the grid because I wasn't getting solar. Um, I had had a conversation. Mhm. Right. With Cindy back on ***, uh, March **th, and it was my understanding that I was gonna get some DocuSign documents for reimbursement for that * months of service that I paid, um, plus I was going to get the amount of the utility bill paid, um, since you guys are supposed to provide me with power and I was also supposed to have an extension of my discounted period for a full year, um, and I. Sure. OK. So I, I never received any of that stuff and I'm not sure I I even have solar working now so a lot of, a lot of things, yeah, money and then that and that activity of the solar at all so. Sure. All right, I understand. So Christopher, what I've done is looked up your phone number. I did find an account. I think this is yours if you would just [REDACTED]. Is that you? That, yeah, that is me. All right perfect so then I did find the the case um here where communications went down um I do see that the job was completed. I've brought up the system. I do show production and I show total production so far that's been measured is *** kilowatts. Um, I do see notations from Cindy, and she did submit a request here. I don't know if there was an approval or or what has happened since, so let me follow up with her. Um, I did send her a message and ask if she was available to take the call. She just responded she said she is on the phone and then she will call you as soon as she is off of this call. So if I could just give her the phone number that you're calling on, would that be the best callback number for you? Yeah, sure. Um, Alright perfect. Well just just give me that the *** generated was for for what period? Um, let's see here. I just brought open the last ** days. Let me just see what day I have from the *st to the *st. So the first, uh, it is showing system produced measured **th of March. The first of what? What? March *st to April *st. Until April *st. Yes, sir. OK. Yes sir, so total, total amount here now let me just extend um up until today and get a precise amount. Total up until today shows to be *** total kilowatts from the *st of March up until today, um, including what it's so far produced for today. It shows measured to be just right over *.* kilowatts. So it looks like there might be some shade or some clouds up there because also on April *th and the *th, it shows to be producing a little bit lower than anticipated. But on the *th, it did a good job, measured at a little over ** kilowatts. But the best overall day shows to be on the *st your system measured **.** kilowatts. So it looks like there's some clouds in play here. Maybe weather's not being as cooperative, but I wouldn't expect that to be uh a prolonged situation, you know, now that we're, we're coming up with the change of season, hopefully. Mm. Yeah, yeah, it's been raining the last two days. Yeah. Yeah, it's been raining the last few days. Um, so what I Yeah, so that, that, that attributes to that. While I've got you on the phone, I mean, I'm looking at. This tool, and I know you don't use the um whatever the old tool was for me to gain visibility, which is really frustrating or disappointing. So I mean, the tool I have, uh, is showing nothing produced for January, February, March, um, April is not even shown on the graph. What tool is that? Uh, I don't know. It just says this is the beta version of Pothogen's customer portal which is still undergoing final testing before that. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the customer portal. Yeah, I know what you're talking about now. OK, so yeah, so it should. What other, what other tools that I have or can I have? What other tool can I get that can show me my production? Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't know. That's why I was, that's why I was asking because you said that you had an older one. That's why I was asking what you were using. So I know exactly what you're talking about. I just know that that information should update on a monthly basis, why it's not showing on your portal, I'd have to ask IT because I have access to um the locus and unfortunately it doesn't allow me to share this access with you, but I can send you screenshots of everything that I'm looking at and and I can send you the the reports if that that would be helpful to you. Yeah, I mean, It, it would, but I mean, I was promised that I was gonna be able to be able to have visibility to, to my own solar, and it sounds like I, I don't. I mean, people, people have visibility to their solar? I mean, this is kind of ridiculous, isn't it? I mean, shouldn't you have visibility? Well, I I apologize, Christopher, that the only thing that I'm What your system's producing in live time so you can. I mean, all my other friends with different types of solar have, you know, have little apps on their phone. They can see what it's producing on an hour to hour basis at ** minute increments. I mean, if they turned off their, their lights, it actually shows, uh, it shows their usage and it shows their production, um, you know, with different, different types of solar systems. I mean, this seems barbaric that I'm getting generations of like a month later. I'm not even getting it actually a month late. I just like one bar that shows, you know, a month. After the fact. You know what I mean? Right, I hear you and I apologize I'm unable to provide anything further to you. I know that Posen is working on developing that kind of visibility for our customers, but at that point that we are right now, the only thing we have is that customer portal. So again, I can share the information that I have access to, you know, in the screenshots and the reports, but I wouldn't be able to provide you like a username and login credentials per se, and I really do apologize that I, I don't have more to give you. OK. Yeah. All right, well, no, I know, I'm not blaming it on you. I, I don't mean to be frustrated with you. It's just, it's just frustrating, and it would seem to, it would seem to be a useful tool for, for kind of controlling my energy usage and, and using the solar to the best of its capabilities kind of, you know. Um, all right, yeah, so if you can send that and if you could have Cindy give me a call, that'd be great. Oh, you're fine. I agree. Absolutely I'll do that. Any other questions in the meantime, sir? Uh, that's it for now. Thanks so much for all your help. My pleasure. I hope you have a great one. Bye.

Now, that is so sad. Now y'all, this is y'all stuff. I know. I, I'm sorry. And y'all installed that heat, y'all installed that uh that hot water heater. Yeah. Yeah. And And that is so crazy, and I got to get somebody else to come and work on y'all's stuff that y'all installed, and when I did get somebody out there to install it, them people said they don't know, they don't fool with that. And they was, that's a plumbing company. Yeah And that is just so bad business. It is very bad business and I'm just so dissatisfied with, I'm not satisfied with positive at all. I can't believe this. But anyway, I know it's not your fault. I'm just getting out, so um I guess I may just have to take, pay somebody to take the whole thing out. Sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah. They up on to take the whole thing out. You know, and, and, and put another hot water heater in there. But it, like I said, it's not that it's, it's not good for positives.

I was calling to introduce myself. I will be your main point of contact for your project. So I'm gonna be following up biweekly, uh, providing you updates, and I just wanted to know how would you like your updates. Uh, some customers prefer email, others text, what's best for you? OK. OK. Text will be good for me. I can see it right when it pop up. OK. OK, so I'll go ahead and uh text you. I'm gonna text you my name and number, my direct number in case you have any questions throughout the project, you can give me a call and um I'm gonna go ahead and pull your project now to see where we're at currently. OK. Uh, OK, site survey. OK. We did a site survey today, but let me double check that. Um, I know they came out yesterday with the drone and everything. Yes, I. Yeah, it actually, for some reason it has today, but I see that it actually happened yesterday. So, uh, once they're working well so once um so yesterday they took the pictures and things like that we need to design your system and so what they're they're they're doing now is working on the design. Um, I'm not sure um if there's any additional work, so they they also will use that to see if there's any roof work that will be needed. It. OK. OK. Uh, once they have the design completed, then we go ahead and turn it into the, to the engineers to stamp. Um, they, they will also, yeah, and they will also go over the final lease review and um make sure you approve everything, and then once that that's all squared away, we can go ahead and turn in the design to the permitting office, so. OK. You know, right now it's designing right now they're working on the design, OK? Mhm. OK. All right. And Are are a lot of people start to get paid? Mhm. Yeah, they are, um, like I tell customers really, um, the only way to move away from and it's not total, so customers, you know, I don't know if the sales people don't um explain this, but you're never gonna be ***% uh away from the utility company, but the only way to. Yeah, it's You know, OK, wonderful. I'm glad he did because not everybody does, and the only way to kind of move away from them is to actually make your own energy. So panels is a form to not depend on them so much, because as you know, they raised the pride, they can, they just, you know, they can, and unfortunately, it has it's happening more often. Yeah. Yeah And so this is the only way to kind of help with that and offset that. So I can tell customers just be mindful, um, panels work well, but, but remember that the sales person size you for what you use currently. Now, if you go in and and buy a pool and you put heated heated, you know, pool, then that's going to, you know, pull a lot of energy, so you're gonna have to get size again. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So it's just understanding that and and and understanding that you can't, um, you know, use more than what you make, then you'll be fine and, you know, I tell customers try to use the max, like if you're gonna use a lot of energy use it in the, when they're, when the panels are their max, which is in the daylight, you know, it's it's, it's. Mm. Mm. At the daytime, so if you're gonna use a lot of energy, use it then because your panels are making energy. They're at their max peak. So just kind of knowing that is gonna help you like, take use as much as you can, you know, taking advantage of your panels, um, but you're gonna see the the difference. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah Yes. Yeah OK, sounds good. That'll work. Yes, sir. Um, yeah, just, just, just, and then we what at the end, like when they turn on your system, we're gonna provide you a link where you're gonna be able to monitor your system. You're gonna be able to see what these panels are, are doing are producing, OK? OK. Um, uh, other than that, oh, let me ask you, do you have the Posygen app by any chance on your cell phone? I You do? OK, so on there, um, it does have the project status. sometimes it it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it, it's on there, uh, also, uh, in the future when once you're activated, you can, you can see your billing statement on that app, and any payment that possi then sends you will be through the app for every referral. So like if you refer people, um, just put them in the app because Posen will pay you through the app, OK? Yes ma'am. OK. Yeah OK, sounds good. Yeah, right, yeah, right now they do have an incentive for uh of $*** for every person that you put in, and it doesn't matter when they get seen as long as you put them in right now when the incentives is going, because later on, they're gonna drop that to $** so. OK. OK, got you. OK. All right, Mr. Williams. So I'm gonna text you my name and my number again and that way, um, like if you have any other questions, you can call me, OK? OK. OK, sounds good.

Right, I understand. Mhm. And it was working then, but I went back the next day and looked and the lights were off, so it was already the fuses were already blown. So there's, there's another problem. So that's like what, what one technician came that's **** sets of fuses is blown already and like it blows them in like less than a day, most of the time, just * or * hours and it's not working anymore, you know, so and of course my light bill tripled, you know, during that time.

Well, yeah, I unders I understand, but, but I mean, you know, as, as far as I'm concerned, I mean the lease has been, uh, broken, if, if it hadn't been fixed, so I mean, I, I, you know, it's like what do you do, but I'll call billing. I'll talk to them, yeah, I, I think they should give me a credit, you know, for a couple of months anyway because it it hasn't worked, you know, it just hasn't been working. Right, but we're not refusing to fix it, so. Right. That's understandable. So OK, well, uh, uh, uh, I'll just wait to hear something in the next couple of days.

2a7dd8c8-6a28-40fe-93a5-c0b18eb9de86,"Thank you for calling Posaggen. My name is Cindy. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? Cindy, hey, my name is Brandon Dubos. I'm actually a res and a customer in New Orleans. Good afternoon. Hi, good afternoon, Brandon. Um, how can I help you today? I'm calling because as a customer I'm trying to get the login for the Posit app so that I can view my production. Um, can you tell me like where we are with that link, please? Absolutely, bear with me one moment. Can you confirm your address and your phone number, Brandon? Yeah, it's area code ***-***-**** and my address is [REDACTED]. Thank you one moment and. Bear with me just one moment I'm going to get this submitted. For you. Sure. Now you've never had um access to any kind of monitoring or customer portal? That's correct. OK, one moment. May you confirm your email address, Mr. Brandon? Yeah, it's B Dubos*@yahoo.com. Thank you. I'm going to place you just on a brief hold as I try and um get this access for you. I do see here based on the case notes, this has been something that you've been requesting for quite some time and I do apologize. Now, have we ever sent you what is called like a password reset link? I actually just checked my spam folder and it looks like you sent one on February *rd. We'll send you a new one, but I want to see if this is going to work because based on your account. Inquiries. Um, now, Mr. Brandon, have you Has your system been activated to your knowledge? Yeah, I, I know that it has. It got activated more than * months ago. OK. The reason why I ask is because we do have a notation, yes, your system is active, but we're also seeing a a monitoring uh case that has generated from our system just actually a few days ago of a configuration issue, um, which I, I like to be transparent with you is that what's happening is that it seems as though our own monitoring portal has not captivated that your system is already active. So I'm still going to send you over a new link and the link is going to say that your password has been reset, but it's going to be another one prior to that saying that your username has been updated. Now, your username is going to be your email. Which is the email that we have on file. B D U B O. OK. the number * at yahoo.com. So that's your username and I just sent you a new one saying that I updated your password. Can you let me know if you received that one? And go ahead and do your password, check to see if your address is correct, and then click submit. And maybe it did go back again to your spam, but this is the one that I just sent a few seconds ago. Yeah, hold on one second. I'm uh checking now. OK, so I got the one that's your new positing customer portal password, so you want me to click where it says click here. Yes, please. OK, and it's asking me to change my password. Right. Um, Yeah, give me one second. OK, I've done that. So now you'll see your address and then click submit. If the make sure your address is right on there though, please. It was. OK. So now what do you see if you don't mind me asking? Now, um, I see this is a beta version of Pogen's customer portal which is still undergoing final testing before it's released. Please report any bugs or data entry data errors to customer care positing.com then um. There's a box that says equivalent of and there's nothing in there, then it says my solar production, but then the month, year in life, there's nothing there. Then there's a box for generation. And that's gray and there's nothing there. And then there's just a phone number that says pay my bill, the number I called and positive.com, so that's all that. Yes. I have to resubmit an IT ticket um given that even uh like I mentioned to you prior there has it shows that it's active we don't see much more prior to that or ahead from that so I do apologize that we are trying to get everything reestablished with communications as of right now I do apologize that because we are undergoing a lot of changes there's a lot of um. I guess you could say glitches that are still to be sorted out, which I do apologize for you, but um you finally have the access to the customer portal, but there's no history, so I have to submit a ticket for the history to start getting uploaded or migrated into your account. I do apologize that I cannot transfer you right over to the IT department, but they definitely can um try to get everything uploaded as soon as possible. Usually it takes anywhere between * and * days for you to start seeing the history. Um, bear with me just one moment. OK. No, you may be able to give me a little bit more insight given that you are a res. May I ask, when you got your system installed, was it by Posogen? Yeah. OK, now, um, the reason why I ask is that when pathogen did its interconnection and your system became ready for. Permission to operate. Um, we do see here that we're having a bit of a discrepancy for the activation. So I'm not ***% sure if I'm honest with you. Um, what I'm going to have to do is submit a monitoring ticket as well, um, besides the IT ticket for the monitoring, um, history as well as for the activation history. Um, because when that happens is that we're only able to see from activation and that's it. Um, we don't really see anything further more than that, so I do apologize that I do have to escalate this in two different manners, one being our monitoring department and the other one being our IT department. So we want to make sure that we can get this resolved for you. And And I don't, I, I'm trying to understand what you're talking about when you say. There's some issue regarding. Activation and PTO like I, I didn't. I don't know what you're trying to tell me. Can you be more specific, please? Absolutely now what what I see here we have a case that has generated from our monitoring department um and it says to. Show your production or show your node ID which I'm really not sure what that is if I'm honest with you, but the node ID means that when was system activated. So if it's asking that and it's a generated case that means that field monitoring department has not started. Showing or producing production reports from activation, meaning that either you nor I can see if your system was even activated. Well, I can see it as a res when I go in my own file in solutions and I follow the project tracker. And I can see it on my bill because Ey collects and. the amount of kilowatt hours that I send back to them. So obviously if the system was not activated, they would not be counting kilowatt hours from the customer to the company. So like I can see that it's activated, yes, but I can't monitor all of this production, which is what I'm trying. Right, that's exactly what and you're, you're actually way ahead than I am because you, you're exactly what you're saying is exactly what's happening is that I can only see system activation but I see no production. I see no production reports. I the same thing that you're seeing so what I have to do, um, are you aware who our monitoring departments or monitoring department techs are, um, CN by any chance? Um I'm not, I, I don't know really anybody in IT. Um, now this is the monitoring department. The monitoring department is like the people that are working with a spectrum of making sure that customer systems are communicating on a daily basis. So that's one department and uh just to kind of be um letting you know I'm going to send a message to TheN. She's our head uh monitoring specialist and advise to her what's going on with your system and what this. Or, or, or my. case is because it shows that we don't see anything post activation. So post-activation, it's like you never even started generating, but if you're seeing it on your energy bill and if you're seeing Right. Uh, so, Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so like I I know the system's activated. I, I know I got an email saying somebody came out and like I've gotten. $* electricity bills. So I you and I both know it's working. I was just gonna ask, since I'm an employee, are you able to put she and I and you in the same G chat so that this can be a nice learning experience for me as a res to be able to also communicate with our monitoring department heads. If I have other cases where people have onboarded and their system has been activated but they are running into the same problems that I am and I ask that because I know I'm dealing with it. I've I've got customers that are asking me like, where's this access, you know, and then when I asked the IT department, they essentially tell me that going back ** months from right now last April. Yes. We've been trying to onboard people's monitoring from the third party website. Into our own app and so. At this point, I've only been online for about * months, but I have other people that have been activated since like May or June, and it's just like, hey, it's been quite a long time now, so I'm hoping that any kind of insight I can get from the monitoring department about how to tackle this will help me with customers in addition to my own system. Absolutely, and I'm, I'm actually doing exactly what um you just mentioned, and I'm adding you and The on this G chat and it not only will be a learning experience for you, but also for me, um, because this is something I've ran into one time prior to you and what we've been told to do. Perfect Is we send a message not only to IT for customers to have history reloaded, but you've already been told by IT that they're gonna do that exactly what you're saying I've been hearing and with DN I've also been told that we gotta send a message to our monitoring department which is I'm going straight to the end because she's like really good with responding so um. Yeah. Love it. Awesome. The aggregator ID is on the project page because sometimes like if the aggregator is not on there, which yours is um I'm not sure why it's not monitoring or she can tell us like you said uh it's gonna be a learning experience for the both of us to see why and preface why whether it's like a communication issue from the third party like you mentioned or from. The actual, you know, portal, I'm not really sure. Did you get the message by any chance? Yeah. Uh, yeah, I did. I just, I just saw those G chats come through. Thank you for including me there. Absolutely, Brandon. So we'll be in contact through there. I do apologize that I don't have an answer for you right away. Like I mentioned, CN is really quick with responding, especially you working with us. Definitely we want to get this resolved for you and try and have a resolution for you. I do apologize, but, uh, bear with me. Yeah, no problem. I was gonna ask also once we're done with my system if you're able to like look and pivot at maybe some of the customers that. have been asking for this data. Yes. From me. And So as you can see that picture that's your project page or the field asset page that is if you look at where it says monitoring ID aggregator ID if it weren't to say that right there where it says system monitoring then right then and there we're able to send it directly to IT and that should be your solution but because you have those IDs on there that means that when the migration happened from customer portal or sorry from. Solar edge to customer portal, it didn't fulfill at least that's what I'm trying to see or I'm starting to see the pattern, but um it seems as though that the monitoring department and that's why I also asked about that case number ******* that case number was generated automatically from monitoring department and pretty much it says to um that the node ID currently showing for the opportunity shows to have never been um. Monitor or have access for monitoring and that's just a general case that has automatically created um so if you like now that I've sent over that I'm going to. Bear with me just one moment. Alrighty, Mr. Brandon, so I've updated your account. I'm going to submit that ID ticket already and we can go on to the next customer. One moment. OK. And pretty much I'm, I'm sure that the other agent that you spoke to just recently has also sent in that IT ticket so I don't want to have one moment. Mhm. I don't think I've spoken to anybody like in over a month. OK, so I hope that I'm going to still submit the ID ticket. I just don't want that like, you know how whenever you submit one and then you submit another one, it causes a delay on the first one. So I mean, I'm glad. Um, because they're like doing double jobs, so I don't want that to happen. I don't think this is going to happen, but I'm still going to submit it for you because it seems as though we're still having a lot of one moment. Handling this customer portal case. OK. It seems like this is something that has. Just spoke with customer just having an issue logging in to look. Mm, I'm just reading other notations. OK, so I've submitted the IT ticket and I'm also going to. Escalated for field monitoring, but that's the only way that um. See and can also see the case um. To be able to try and expedite this for you and we can try and get this maybe like the way you and I are learning it would be something to be able to assist customers furthermore that are happening the same issues so let me finish this up. Yeah. And I went ahead and submitted that now I'm ready for the next customer. I'm sorry. OK, um. Patricia, P A T R I C I A. O'Brien O B R I E N. Thank you and may you confirm the address please? Yeah, [REDACTED]. One moment. Thank you. I don't see um just to kind of tell you ahead of time, I don't see any cases that are generated like yours had for monitoring access. Uh, if you like we can send the customer the have they ever been sent the same email like I sent you where the user name was updated and password was updated? Well, uh, it this is where it gets complicated like mine went to junk. If I ask the customer, they'll say no, but they may have gotten it. They've requested for it in the past. I have specifically called on their behalf. To request it as well so. Maybe nobody input the case when I called a few months ago to get it, so. I see where you spoke with Rosemary back in November. I, I'm, I'm sort of like. middle Yeah. Yes, and it does look like. Yeah, so can you see that they That they send it to them. There's an IT ticket number here. For visibility, but I would like to let you know that in January Posaggen underwent a uh a large change when it came to customer monitoring portal. Um, we were going to and just to give you insight, I believe I remember that we were going to go with one route for customers to have a certain um a certain way to customer portal, but then I believe we went through a different monitoring access and different customer portal. So with that huge change IT let us know to no longer submit these kind of IT tickets and they've given us the access here in the customer care department to send customers that link that I sent you earlier which back in November we did not have that way to send that back in December we did not have that this did not come about to about mid January where we were able to now start sending customers access to the customer portal. So if you like, what I can do is I can contact the customer with you on the line um and within hopes that if they're able to just have a few minutes to see what we see because I, for instance, I'm looking at their production report on Solar Edge and Locus and let's see what it shows because if it's different and we can see history then. Yes, so we can see history. So customer does have more access than you do, my apologies, but they, they're able to see their history, uh. And that's OK, so, so. We have one. I don't want you to call this customer with me on the line because she works and doesn't like phone communication. OK. But *, it sounds like you are confirming for me that she has access to this history. Well, we can get her access. She may not have access right now. We can set her up just like I set you up earlier in the call, but you remember where you saw that nothing, it showed *, everything for her, actually we see history, we see production, we see numbers, we see everything. Right. In fact, for yours, we don't see anything, so hers is in a better standing, in other words. OK, so I. Right, so Yeah. Well, uh, is there a way you can share that data with her via email or or in a screenshot to me and G chat like. Essentially, she's been Communicating with me about a lack of awareness of her system's production and I wanna get information to her that says this is what it is, this is what it's done and and and I don't have a way I don't even know what it looks like so is it broken down by month? How about we do this? Yes, and, and I'm going to send you something real quick um because. I'll be quite honest with you. I know that you work for us and I really do, um, want to help you because I know that this can be stressful, especially being a res and having the customer call you and that's what we're here for, but I just sent you a G chat. Can you tell me if you received it? And in that G chat, I want you to see how what I see. Look at it and this is separate from the ends because I don't want it to confuse her, um, look at what I just sent you. OK. Right. I don't I don't have it yet. Sorry, one moment, I don't know why it became a link. OK, so look at look at what I just sent you this is for. April. If you open it, this is what the customer just like if you were to have monitoring, this is April's production thus far. And if you look at the little drop down, you're able to see January, February since activation. So if you like, she has access to be able to start seeing this. If you can reach to her and be like, hey, I've been speaking with Cindy in the customer care department. Call in, ask for her, and she'll be more than glad to help you. I'll remember her. That way she can call me. I'm here * to * and I can get her walk through the process of having access to the customer portal. OK. Got it. Which includes the monitoring as well. OK. Um, But this is what typically you would have had seen. It's, it's like you see where it's your, your, how much you produced this month, different things like that. Uh, Yeah Yeah, no, OK, so. Yeah. OK, so this. This brings up another question. Um, I'm looking at the screenshot and it's super cool and I appreciate you sharing this with me, Cindy, but like what I'm looking at is **** there's a little bit in March and April like. I guess that's *** kW or a little bit more and then a little bit more than *** kW in April and then I don't see any columns in May, June, July, August and September. Can you help me out with why that is from **** like there's no blue columns. Great question. Let's take a look. Do you know why that would be? I don't see Cause this customer, I didn't even meet with, I didn't even meet with this customer. Until April. So there should be no blue in March and April unless this system is counting production on somebody else's house and then this system was activated in July, in which case I would expect the blue column to start in August and September. Right, one moment, that's probably the messaging us. Yeah. And so Like, I'm cool that this is where it is, but Yes, it definitely sparks up another question. This customer is gonna come back. Yeah, like this customer is gonna come back and be like, hmm, why is there production in March when this system wasn't activated until July and why is there no production in July, August and September so. One moment. I don't. I want to send this to her even though in **** the numbers look fine like that's what I would expect it to be doing in January, February and March based on her system size and lack of trees and the direction her roof faces, right? So, um. I'm not sure why it does say that like that because I'm looking at **** and this system was actually activated in March of ****. I start seeing communications, that bottom graph, the comparative energy bottom graph, I think that that's a little bit different or it kind of is going to throw off a customer because this shouldn't be. I just I don't, I'm not, I, I really wish I could tell you how to explain you this bottom part of it, but if we look at, I'm looking at March, April, nothing, there's no production prior to the middle of March. Uh, technically, to be exact, it shows March **th. System started producing of ****. Right, but This you're talking about you're talking about ****, right? Right, yes. Yeah. This customer Patricia O'Brien. As long as we're talking about the same person, I didn't have this meeting with her until April. So that's what I'm trying to tell you. There's no way, there's no conceivable way that this system should have production in March and in April. Yes, I see that too. Because she didn't even sign up. Until April, right? And then the system got activated like July **th. So I But I don't there's clearly something incorrect here with this particular systems monitoring even though it shows her address. Like it's just, it's just not. This is not accurate reporting, so. That is correct. I do agree with that and I'm looking at the boarding time and it looks like customer was boarded and activated in July like you said. Or April, but it was, it was technically you did the appointment April, but then they didn't get activated till July, so why is there a production and then I don't see no production. Right. Correct. I see production. I literally see no production. Yeah this is I think the monitoring department has is really like really wrong because I see that there's production in June for one day. And then I think that what we see for April is supposed to be for July. I'm thinking that like I'm, I'm literally thinking what I see from March and April that's not supposed to be for March or April. I think this is supposed to be for July. I think our monitoring department has it wrong and they have chosen to be for March when it's supposed to be for April, I'm sorry, for July. System did not become active until July. I mean, It's certainly possible that those blue graphs are in the wrong month. I ***% agree with that, but. Um, You know, like, uh, it looks good for January, February, March, like no, you know, issues there for this year. But I've reviewed the customer's bills like in a spreadsheet in detail with her husband. For an hour going through and pulling like the All the charges from the energy bill including our stuff that links like this is the kilowatt hours from the company to the customer from the customer to the company like I've broken down the bill so I know that there is production in July, August and September of last year that's not reflected on this chart so I don't, I don't wanna go like back and forth with you because. The screenshot if it were accurate would be great. I would love to see this for my for my own system but also for every customer but it but I can't show this. To this customer because she's gonna say well you're not even you're charging me money but the system's not working and it was working earlier before I even met with you that doesn't make any sense like it's gonna. Be confusing and frustrating for her, so let's just, I mean if you wanna create a ticket here. For this system don't do it, but. I just want the customer to be able to log in and see it and. Emailing her is better to do that than for us to try to get her on the phone and if you email her that's great if we get she gets a company generated email that's great too but we can figure this out later but it's good to know that this is what it looks like because when done correctly. This is a great chart to look at. Right, and I really appreciate your input and your patience, Mr. Brandon because I am also learning just as we as you are when it comes to this activation and newest monitoring portal situation that we've been having, but I can definitely send Ms O'Brien an email um just to let her know that she has a username and a password because that's technically all I can send her, but I don't know if it's best for that's OK? OK. That's great. Just uh no, no, totally do that. Just say hey I wanted to make sure that you knew that you could look at your production in the Positgen app. You know you have a username and password there. You know, like, uh, it's just very general like that you don't even have to say like Brandon called in. You don't have to say we looked at your like none of that just hey wanted to double check that you knew you could monitor the system in the portal like that's it, you know. OK, absolutely. And I think she would. Absolutely I went ahead um the email that I have on file for her I can tell you right now it is one moment. O'Brien PatriciaJ at gmail.com. Um, I think that's the one I have. I'm gonna double check my emails real quick. Make sure Uh, yes, that's correct. Fantastic. So I'll be sending her those general emails for access to the customer portal within hopes that if at any point she does contact you, Brian, you can always let her know to call me. My name is Cindy like I mentioned to you, Brian, and we can try and assist her with whatever she may have, um, and as you can see what Dean is saying, we're getting, I'm actually learning this, um, I'm not sure why. Why she said that she was gonna send it to field services because it it's, it's already in field services. Like it it in I'm looking at. Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't either. I'm just appreciative that she's jumping on it now, um, you know, and hopefully it'll get to somebody who can, you know, fix it and send me what I need, but the reality is. Like essentially everybody that I onboarded because I started last February and started signing people up in March, every single person. Has not gotten access to this at least as of like the end of last year when we were still working on this so I have. Dozens, I mean like I, I've, I've almost signed up *** people in a year and a month and so. I am feeling it from people who want to get access to this information yet. Like I don't have it on my own system. Yeah, and, and, and like. With the screenshot we just looked at. Yep, and I do recommend if at any point I know that it can become overwhelming especially now that it's post sales it's more of a customer care situation by all means you can always let them know, you know, call them, call the customer care portal we've already been instructed to start, you know, submitting these IT tickets in a different manner. Uh, you know, so Um, getting customers access and just like I was walking you through Brandon letting you know, hey, what do you see like I that's what we've been trying to make sure that we can assist customers so that way we know what to notate post the call to the IT department. Look, this is what they see and you know we don't see much more after that or we do see everything just add it from the beginning of activation, same thing with Ms. O'Brien. Given that I've never really seen that where the graphs are in the wrong month or there's a discrepancy of when the activation actually happened based off of solar edge and the CRM which is our customer uh CRM is our pinnacle where we're able to see all the cases that each account has so different things like that can definitely. Yeah, yeah, we use nickel as well for sale. Oh great, yes. I do apologize for this and I really appreciate your patience, Brandon. No, it's all good. I, I'm not instead of like asking you about other customers, Cindy, I think. If you just share with your superiors and the people that deal with monitoring specifically that. There's a backlog and there is a need to. Hopefully be proactive with our customers and tell them, hey, if you haven't logged into the portal yet, just view your production. You now have access to it, do that. Here's how you can do it and if there's an issue and you can't see anything, call us at this number like I would absolutely love it if the. You know, ** or ** people that I have that are that have been activated all got an email like this week that's just very simple and straightforward like that. I've probably got another ** or ** people that are still waiting on PTO. In various stages, but I've definitely got dozens of people who are active and I think giving them the power pun intended to view their production would be awesome. So um that's just my feedback that I wanna give to you that I hope you can pass up the, you know, chain or whatever to be proactive and send people out that kind of generic simple email so that they can get registered. And you know what, Brandon, I'll be honest with, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Brandon, but I had knowledge that they did every customer, old and new, has gotten that email of when and where to sign up. Now we have now instructed the boarding team, the team that does the pre-call like right before they become inactive, right before, sorry, right before they are fully boarded, they get a call, and when they do that. Um, I think that'd be a huge, huge impact. The boarding team is supposed to take steps to be able to go and have this customer to have the customer portal. So I believe. This is something that we have been instructed to do, but rest assured I will definitely do that. I will speak to my team leads and I also will speak to our customer care department about this, uh, but keep in mind that I do apologize that this is something that has been ongoing even prior to me starting to work here. I knew, I do know that as soon as I started working here, a lot of customers were asking, Where's my portal? Where's my portal? Where's my monitor? Where's my monitoring? OK. And we weren't able to be even give them anything we just kept saying wait a minute, wait a minute, and then we ended up seeing where we, we were able to submit IT tickets and then that was not supposed to be done and then now we're supposed to have the boarding team start doing that but whenever customers are already established they've already been boarded just like how you've been. Than us here in the customer care we go ahead and start doing the process for the monitoring department. So just like you and I are going to be learning with DN because DN is winners are one of the most, um, like I said she's she's the director for monitoring and um she has been. Oh Doing a lot of back end work for customers old and new, so rest assured that we are trying to get that resolved, but I do think that uh by me sending a message to the I'm also going to, you know, contact her and let her know look this is something that I have been seeing a lot lately, especially with the your case that you have. I feel like if she sent you ready, ready to schedule. I'm not sure why it was sent already to schedule if it was already in field services. That's something I'm also trying to figure out, but rest assured that I will definitely let my superiors know and also let the monitoring department know. OK.

Uh, were you trying to get to our, our, our sales team? Were you trying to get to customer care? So what? I'm trying to find out why I'm paying more money, why they went up on my. Monthly payment.

To across Philadelphia getting a glimpse this week of one of the potential paths for their future. Jackson came at all high school this morning with the school visit host. Got you. OK. So it looks like you were on a promotion, uh, **** for * months. Uh it looks like that promotion, uh, actually it may have been a little bit longer than * months. Let me see. ***** no, it was about * months, yep, so you're on a promotion **** for * months. Uh, it looks like your pro your promotion actually just ended, uh, a couple of days ago. So March was your last month. Uh, **** is the normal payment now and then, of course, moving forward as well. I So, so why is mine went up and some people are saying they're not paying anything. They had this way before me. Uh, I'm not sure. Uh, I'm not sure specifically what, what cases you're, uh, you're referring to as far as, you know, the, the contracts for some of the people you may know. I will say though, uh, sometimes there are differences in promotions, sometimes there are differences in, in general costs, um, depending on how long they've had it and how long their term was for. sometimes their promotions where there, there may be a credit for a while where they don't have to pay anything at all, um, but generally that's due to system outages. So if for whatever reason the system was. To be out, um, in order to not charge you, you know, for the amount of months maybe where you have paid, you know, we'll, we'll kind of write you, you know, write off the payments for a while until they kind of picks back up. Um, but in this particular case, yeah, I mean, it looks like, uh, you know, you, you started with us fairly recently, some time last year, late last year, and so, yeah, it looks like they had you on a promotion starting in October, uh, for * months. So it looks like this is now your, your *th month and so that promotion just just fell off. That's all. And why they, why they didn't make you aware that you will be paying that only for * months. I'm not sure. When you, when you spoke to your salesperson, he didn't notify you of the promotion and, and how long everything was gonna be on. So No, he did not. Got you. Let me ask you this. What, um, and, um, I don't, I don't, I could pull up the contract here, but what, uh, what payment did he tell you you'd be paying for the entirety of the contract? **** a month. Got you. Yeah. OK. Yeah, and, and I mean that's. And they've been taking it from my, they were taking it from my account every month. Yes, ma'am. I get you. Let me see here. Let me see where he put, if, if you put the **** on your contract, then what I'll do is just have them, uh, rebook your account to make sure that you end up back at that ****. Let's see. That is taking the Let's see Uh, of course we're gonna begin here with a few. OK, so it looks like the, I'm not sure if you have a copy of it. It looks like the agreement that was signed off on by you uh was for ****. Did, were you aware of that? It was signed off for ****. Yes ma'am. That's what you say? Yes, ma'am. Detail Well, I don't know what you mean by that. Not after he said and told me and I would get it in the mail, got the paper in the mail that out, they will be uh uh taking **** from my. Check every month. Mhm Yeah, yeah, it looks. From my credit card. What it, what it looks like what I'm gonna assume happened, um, and I say this only because I don't have any notes here from the salesperson. What I'm thinking happened, uh, the contract itself is for **.**. Uh, that was the one that looks like that he drew up for you, uh, and the one that I have the signature from. What I, what it looks like happened, the **** promotion isn't actually something that's involved in the contract. It's, it's an, you know, it's something external. But more than likely what seems like it happened and what happens a lot, uh, is that the, the contract you signed off on is for the regular price. They, of course, being the sales people, they communicate to you the promotion price, um, but a lot of time they don't tell you, you know, that the promotion price isn't actually on the contract. And so that ****, um, isn't something that was, that's required. Generally, sales people do it, you know, if they, you know, want to save you some money for the first few months or something along those lines. And so that's, that's what he did. Looks like that **** uh was, was on there for six months, uh, but it looks like. The contract that he originally drew up, um, and the one that, like I said, I have a signature from you here, uh, was, was for that **.** for the next ** years. Um, I could reach out to the salesperson and see if you, you know, can maybe reach out to you with kind of offer an explanation or kind of specifically what, you know, what went wrong, but yeah, that would be kind of a reason at least for the ****, um, looks like the payment schedule shows that's what was agreed to. OK Yeah. If you reach out to him because I've been reaching out to him. He haven't been picking up the phone and I don't know why. OK. Got you. Who was your, who was your salesperson? Do you know his name? Oh, he's on his phone somewhere. If you got the con the the uh paperwork in front of you like and his name up there. Well, I was gonna say I have here it looks like. Let's see, I have Joshua, Mr. Joshua. I'm not sure if that was the person who Yeah That's him. Uh, that's it. OK, got you. So I can reach out to him, see if he can, if he can kind of touch base with you, figure out, you know, kind of what, what went wrong, but yeah, that, I'm sorry about that. But yeah, that's kind of to, to offer an explanation as to as to what happened. Looks like you're in your, your *th month and it was only a * month promotion. OK, yeah, do that and have him call me right away because that **.** is a little deep coming out of my account. OK. The number you All the set. The number you call from, is that a good number for you to be contacted on? Yeah Yes. OK. All right. I'll go ahead and pass that over to him and have him give you a call as soon as possible.

Do you have any questions regarding that information? That it's funny you called me because I just contacted Solar Hauler yesterday or yesterday last week about because I hadn't heard anything and I didn't want to get behind on the lease payment because I don't like to be, uh, I wanna do auto pay if that's even a thing for you with you all. Mhm Mhm. You, you're already set up for autopay. I don't, I don't wanna forget. OK, good. Mhm. Yes, already set up to be drafted on the *th of each month, and your drafting won't start until about ** days after this call when you receive your first bill.

Um, there's gonna be account information on there that you can use to go on supposit.com to access your billing information and all all payment information in general. Sorry OK, cool. That was my next question. Mhm. Yes. Awesome. Because we might we're changing we're changing our credit cards around us we'll put it on our new one.

Would you like for me to do that? OK. Yeah, that'd be fine. Yeah. Awesome. I'm gonna send that to the email you just confirmed. We're keeping the other card, but we're just switching it to another one that gives us more points. Got you. Um, uh, we have a new and a reward system and this one gives us extra points for it, so. OK Awesome, that's completely fine. So I just sent it it should be an email now, um, and again you're gonna receive that first bill in the mail around the end of next month, and then you'll be drafted, well, as of now you're set up to be drafted on the *th of each month. So if you keep it on the *th, um, you'll get that first bill around the end of next month and be drafted either on the *th of June or the latest the *th of July. OK. Mhm. Are there any other questions I can address? Awesome. The last question I had, yeah, I got one more question. Uh, my wife and I went with the lease because we didn't know if we were wanting to purchase it and so we decided to do the lease to see if everything would work out so far it is, uh, when is they told us we get a buyout option at a certain time? Do you, do you know? Yes, sir. Mhm. Mhm. Uh, when, when that is. So let me just pull up the lease agreement. It has an exact area um that could tell you that answer and I can even send you a copy of that lease agreement so you could see for yourself. Would you like for me to do that? Yeah, that's fine. Awesome, um, so the page you wanna pay attention to. Because at the moment we're gonna buy it out whenever that we get that. Mhm. Alrighty, so here on page number *, under option number * it says purchase and you may purchase the system at a price to be determined by reference to um a readily available independent source that will be I'm sorry, identified that will identify and disclose to you at least *** days prior to the end of the initial term so. *** days before the ** years is up is when you have the option to purchase the system. They told us like a year * or year * is what I understood. I just didn't know which one I remember which one it was. Well, let me see if there's anywhere else in the lease agreement that states anything about the system being purchased. One second. Would you mind holding for * *nd, Matthew? Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. OK. You are on hold. The answer to this. She's busy. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. Hello Matthew. Yes. Yes, um, I apologize for the wait, um, and thank you for holding. Um, so after reviewing your lease agreement, um, it does still say that *** days before the system is, um, the lease is done, but I wanna do a little bit more research before I give you a concrete answer on that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know that's not right. That's not right because what that when that that was the whole only reason we didn't lease because he told us we get a buyout option that year I think he said year * year * from the gentleman uh from Solar hauler and. Yeah. Yeah, um, and I, that's why I say it doesn't seem so outside of the scope of possibility, so that's why I wanna do a little bit more research before I give you a con a concrete answer on that. Um, so I'm gonna give you a call back with that full answer. Is that OK with you? I just didn't remember which one. OK. OK, yeah, that's fine. Awesome, awesome is there anything else I can address at this time? No, that's all. Thank you for your help. Thanks for calling today. Of course it's not a problem um I just have a few more things before we conclude um I do want you to keep an eye out for your email. I'm gonna be sending you a link to your passage and customer portal that's gonna give you access to monitor your system performance. It'll ask you to create a password, and when you do, it'll take about ** to ** days for that monitoring access to be loaded onto your profile. So create the password and then check back in about ** days and everything should be up and running for you. OK. OK. And lastly, um, are you satisfied with the level of service you've received thus far? Yeah. So, so happy to hear you had a positive experience. We gotta get that whole lease thing ironed out, but that's the only thing that's a little irritating at the moment. It's hopefully you fix that. Yeah, um, I do wanna, like I said, I just wanna do a little bit more research before that is given. Out with a full chest of air. So, um, I'm gonna give that to you when I get a chance, OK? Um, yeah, other than that, everything was a positive experience. Right. Yeah, absolutely.

ce9782b6-196c-4059-b064-66f2db3af44e,"Thank you for calling Posen. My name is Joanne. Whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with today? My name is Hillary. Hi Hillary, how are you? I'm doing all right. How about you? I'm good. What can I do for you today? So I am a, I am a current customer, but I cannot get into my account like using the app or even if I go online. OK. Um, and I think it's because y'all have the wrong email address for me. Let me see. OK, that's what I was gonna say let me see what we have on file and and make sure that we actually sent the link to the right place. OK, so first of all, Yeah, cause when I tried to go in and say. Mhm. And I, I was, I was trying to go in and say that, you know, oh I forgot my password and then you know, to send me the thing and it wouldn't, I would never get it. So then I said, well, let me put in, I forgot my login information. So I put, I forgot my login information and I put my email in there and it says my email doesn't exist in the system. So. OK, alright, let's let's figure this out here. So first let me get to the account so that I can get to that um place where I can send and and verify where we sent that access to. So Hillary, what's the address? It is ***. Coal landing, which is shortened to LDG. OK. Laplace, Louisiana. Got it. Alright, so the email that I show here is H as in Hillary, P as in Preston, Z like Zulu, Preston, R like Romeo **@gmail.com. Is that right? That is, that's correct. Alright, perfect. Now that we've confirmed that, let me get to the next point and see if we have sent this link to you. And I do not see that we have sent this link so that's why the user name does not exist because we never sent the access to it so let me do that. Hold on just a second. Oh Oh, no, no. All right. And aside from this, how's everything going for you, Hillary? Um, so far, OK. All right, great. I haven't um had any issues, I don't think. Fantastic fantastic so I sent an email to you it will give you a link where you can reset your password to create a new one that will take you to our customer portal where you can see the system production on a monthly basis and then it'll also give you another area where you can log in and create so you'll create a new access. OK. Um, even though you're creating a new password right now, you'll have to create new access for the billing portal if you wanna access there, and then there's also another portion that will allow you to get into referrals if you want to submit referrals and get paid out for those as well. OK, let me see. Cause I think I did this all already cause um when, you know, when the guy came and we find everything and everything um. Mhm. But hey, I'll do it. I'll do it again. Let me see what I put in there. I think. And it could have reset to be honest, it could have reset from the time that you know he set it up and and we placed, you know, our account system in the in the service, yeah. What did I put in there? I think it did, because. I think it did because let me tell you like where it like it tells you um this is the step we're at. It stopped at the permit part and it just never kept, it never went anywhere from here. Uh, So it probably was a glitch then. So that's why I know I've done all this before. Uh-huh. Yeah, sounds bad, sounds bad well let me know if you got that email please. OK, I did, I did get the email and I'm trying to see if it lets me in. It's saying um To reset the password. So let me go ahead and change password and see if it lets me in. OK, good. Uh, let's see here Submit **, yeah, that's right, submit. OK. My account, pay my bill. I think I'm in there. Now, what is it I'm doing? I can do what on here? You can see the production of the system. I see where I can pay my bill. Yes, yes, that's. How do you do that? Well, let's see here. What options do you see on your. My solar production. There it is. Do you see any anything that says click there? OK. Oh, I see it now. It says my solar production, yeah, it's a little bit further down, and I can do month, year, and life. OK. OK. Alright, so that's production. I can see where you can go and pay the bill. Alright, great. Alright, yeah, I have my bills set up on the on it like it just comes out automatic. No I don't think I need to just bill pay thing. Alright, and will the password be the same for the app if I have the app? Yes, it should definitely. If you set it up that way, that's the password you normally use, we don't have access to reset it. OK. Like it, like on your without your, you know, receiving a link kind of like I just did today. OK. All right, well, let me see if it lets me in now because uh. Let's see, project stages. Did it update that? No. It's still at the stage where it says permit submission. Project stages, is that, is that where, is that what you're wanting like an update on the project? Yeah Oh well, no, cause I've had it for a while, but that's what I'm saying like it, it stopped at that at that stage where it says uh something about the permit and it never went any further than that. OK. Mhm. Yeah, I'm not sure why that is, to be honest. So like when I first got it, I was getting something. Yeah. Yeah, I was getting updates and it was like, OK, contract approved, and then, you know, welcome to Posy again and then like it it was moving along and then it just stopped at * at stage *. It never went any further. Right. That's so odd. I wonder why that is because I can get into the project details and and it tells me everything went through. Yeah. I have no idea. And it even gives me like, like dates of when it was completed so I, I, I wonder that's a little odd. I'll talk to the IT guys and see if maybe that that was a glitch or something. I'm gonna log out and then I'm gonna log back in. And let me see. I log back in. So it's my email. That's my password. Let me see if it updates. Yeah. Mm. Nope, it's stuck like that. It's still like that in there. And then also when I go into the my wallet thing. Mhm. Um, My info is not in there either, and I, and I have it set up to like automatically come out of something that it's not showing in there. Alright, let me reach out to the IT team and and see if we can get some help with that, OK? For the my wallet it's showing your information like no contact details it just has payment information tied to it, right? OK. Uh, it doesn't even have that. There's nothing in there. Like I never set it up. Can you edit anything? Does it allow you to? Um, let's see. No. I'm mm. No. Nothing that allows you to edit? No, let's see, that's the adds. OK. OK. OK. Alright, so let me submit this and. Well, I got into the account. Yeah. So I'm gonna Go into it online instead of on the, on the app, because The app is not The app's not right. And when you, when you try it online, are you seeing the same information? Let me see what it says. Oh well no I closed out. How do I get back in there? Should be able to go to positive.com. Yeah. Hardrogen portal. Take care. OK. What? Why aren't you it says log in sales, check the username of let me. Oh, so the user name is gonna be your complete email, and then after the dot com it's gonna be *** for the address. Oh, OK. Yeah, I did not put that in there. OK, so I have to put the *** after. Mhm. Yeah. Yes, after the dot com. ***. OK. All right. Uh, it's still saying login failed. That's so odd. Mhm Right, there's a space there that I didn't put there, back space. OK. No. Let me try retype in my password. Login failed, check username or password. But it works when you go through the app. Thank you. Or that link that I sent you. No, it's not, now it's not working. Now it's not working there either. Oh no. Um, at gmail.com and then just *** right behind the dot com with no, no dashes or anything, just. Right, right, no dash or anything. It's HPZPR**@gmail.com. ***. Dot com And then just ***. No, no dots. Oh no, there's a dot. There's a dot com.***. That now. Oh, so ***, OK. Yes, yes, sorry, sorry, yes, definitely **. Dot com.**. Yes. OK. Mm. No, log and sale. Um. OK, let's try one hold on I'm gonna send a reset link. You really fine. Let me set the reset link, see if that works now. OK. The password has been reset, click here. OK. new password. OK, I see what it is. It's HPVPR at gmail.com. ***. OK, so my new password and Yes. Right. You cannot use this old password. I know, because that's what I said. And so now it's telling me that was bad. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. OK. Uh, Wow, this is I say. I'm so sorry. OK. All right. It's letting me in, select the location where you wanna view. All right. Thank you for being patient. That's all right. OK, so now I'm back in. Great. Um, If I want to see. Like how much I paid for like the year of **** cause I, I was, I was what got me started on this because I'm doing my, oh, you'd have to give it to me. OK, cause I'm I was doing my taxes and I was like, well, maybe I can just I'd have to give that to you. Yeah, I can, I can give you those statements, yeah. OK, alright, yeah, I thought I could find it on here. I was like I could probably pull it up on here and then just, you know, put it on my taxes, but I'm glad I called. Yeah, maybe, maybe some of those statements, yeah, some of those statements might be there and, and maybe they're not all complete. So just to make sure that we're not missing any information, it's always best that you just call and I'll email it to you. So let me just pull up what I have here. OK. All right, well that's great. And then if you ever have questions about your billing or anything at all, you can always call us and and we'll help you know it doesn't matter what it is. So let's see here statements give me a moment. Oh it's not pulling up anything. Hold on, I think maybe this is not the right information. Give me a second. Mhm. I don't know why I brought up a Hillary Reid. Was that a previous name you had? So, Preston is actually my previous name. Reed is my married name. OK, OK. But my, my house, when I bought my house, it was under my maiden name, so they had to put Preston on, so we sent it, uh-huh. There it is. I found it. OK, so they updated to the to the read and so the read didn't pull any statements, but the Preston does so here they are. OK, I found it. OK. So I have October through March. So I'll download those. Mhm. So I got * of them total for you. And then I'll send that to the email. Give me just a second here. And in the subject I'll put your statements. OK. Congratulations on getting married. I don't think I've been married for years, but um when I bought my house, my house, you know, I bought my house before I got married. So, um, It's always nice. Mhm. OK. Yeah, so that's why my, my house, like the. Paperwork for my house is still under my maiden name. Mhm. And I just never changed it. OK, no worries. So when they got ready to do the solar stuff, they said it had to be under Preston because the house is under Preston. So I was like, OK, well, fine. I won't fight you for it. Right. Right, right. Alright, let me attach these all. All right, and there they go. Did you get the email yet? Let me see. I did. Great. OK. Did you have any other questions for me? Mhm. Uh, no, wait, this is, oh wait, the first one is just an invoice. Wait, let me go back. Oh Well, these are just invoices. Did I send you, let me see, let me see, let me open them up. Oh yeah Yeah, these are just Oh, so it's just see which doesn't even show that it was paid. Oh my goodness. See, when I click on it says this is the statement, statement number. Mm. Yeah, it's on it, yeah, these are just the invoices that um that I've been getting. OK. Let me see what I can get here. So you want proof of payments? Yeah, yeah, for, um, just how much I paid so I could put it on the tax, um. I can, mm. Tax document. OK. The best I can do for you would be this let me send this to you and see if this will work. OK, I'm gonna drop that real quick. Just a second here I'm almost done. OK. No brushing it all because I am definitely multitasking. There it goes. So it's not allowing me like a a formal document like these invoices that I have for you, but I do have all the proof of payments process under your account so that's what I've sent to you. Mhm. Mhm. And it'll have the date and it'll show status process and if there's anything refunded how much was processed and exactly what time it was processed. OK. All right. So then it also has the confirmation numbers there if you need that I can potentially print let me see if it'll let me print anything out. I could potentially print this out it's, it's like a long receipt. Uh, you have to print it or you can uh Let me see, it'll let me download it. Let me go back. But can you just PDF it? Just send me a PDF? Mhm let me see, let me see if this works. I'm gonna send you this one that I just downloaded and tell me if this works for you too. OK. Alright, there it goes. And if that's good then I'll I'll download the rest of them. I didn't realize that I was able to access that so bear with me. OK. Alright, so that's the first one. Second one. Mm. This one's not letting me do it. There. There it goes. All right, let's see what's in here. OK. The first thing you sent me. So the first one is more like just a screenshot of all the payments process like a whole summary of them and then now what I'm sending you is the individual ones, OK? Mhm. Oh, OK. So, So I've only had this since The *th month? Uh, no, there's more, but that's just, that's just the screen. That was the summary. So I have total ones that I'm downloading now are from July up until April *st. So that's the ones I'm going to send you individually. ****? Mhm. So let me finish those. Alright, I'm almost done. I just got like * more. Just one second. Mhm. Goodness. OK, there they go it looks like a total of. No children. *. Let's see. That the same as far as getting. OK. So I thought I had this for a whole year now, but apparently not. Apparently it just started in, in, in what's the *th month? July? Yeah, that's that's the first one I see available in all the statements here. Now, we, we do allow you ** days after the system's placed in the service before we bill you. So you, you receive basically the first month and a half for free. Oh, OK. OK. Let me see when your system exactly went into service here. OK, well, maybe that's what it is. Our recorded activation date shows to be March **th of ****. But I don't see any billing for March of ****. Let me see. Mm. No, let me see if you were on a promotion, maybe that's what it was. Maybe. Mhm. Yeah. I do remember some something. Yeah. Looks like it was a promotion. Because I, I, I even see you got the * for, for *. Hm. Yeah, I don't see anything like it, it's not showing that you're. Behind or anything and I don't see any payment process you know or any invoices processed prior to that date. OK. Yeah. All right. I guess we're good. Well, Mrs. Reed, is there anything else I can do for you? Mhm. No, that's it. All right well I appreciate your call I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks, you too.

Uh. Mhm. He was saying we'll go with the **% and it might produce more. So you're never really um getting rid of your uh your bill at that point for sure. **% will cost your monthly payments less.

You know, so I don't know if that's the best choice or if it isn't or something in between, but I don't think you do have anything in between it's one size or another. So I was kind of concerned about that. Mhm. OK. Um, so I don't know, um, exactly, you know, what was it when, when, when he went out there, but honestly, um, you're never going to be ***% away from the utility. Utility, solar panels have to be connected to the utility. Yeah, I know that. To the grid, and so the utility company is always going to charge you an amount uh for using one, their meter, their, their equipment, right? So you're never gonna not have the uh a bill from them, uh, but it is solar is the only way you will not depend on them ***%. So, as far as sizing goes, I'm not sure what um Mhm. Mhm Right, right. You know, usually the salesperson will look at your bill, and they'll size you based on that bill, um, you know, yes, if you overuse, then you have to put some more, but mhm. Mhm. And then if Yeah, if, um, right, um. I guess after a year of monitoring it, if it's decided more would be better than they put more then I guess. Yes, you can. Mhm. Which Mhm. So rather than run ahead and put some that you're, you know, collecting more than what you'd normally need, although I do have mini splits and could easily spend more. I just don't use them in the winter at all. I just mostly use them for, well, in the fall and in the late spring, it's OK. But um and then for air conditioning when I need it. Yeah. Mhm. Mhm. So I, I don't over abuse it where some people, although it's cheaper to run them for AC than it is for heat. They're not that cheap for heat. But you could go through and use solar if you had it. Mhm. But it, it would take a little too. It, it, it does use some energy to heat in the winter with them. Or whenever I do use it for heat, it does. It's not like, well, it's practically free. Well, um, not here. Right. Right, right. No, I understand. So yeah, I mean, it's just best to see how you do within a year and then after that, if you feel like we need more then at that point you can add more. It's not a problem. Yeah, no Mhm. Uh, so, um, that's where we at. So what I would, what I'm going to do is email you my information that way you have it, um, and if you have any further questions, you can call me or if you have any concerns, you can call me, we can, you know, you'll have my direct line. Mhm. Yeah. OK. OK, all right. All right, ma'am. Thank you. I'll be, so your name will be on the email, right? Yes, ma'am. My name and my direct number. Ali. Cause I didn't quite catch your name. OK.

Uh, account, I'm, I'm an engineer and so I'm, I'm looking at she's selling the house and we're looking at, uh, information about the existing solar output. OK. I, I give you the account number. Account number is ***. Yeah. ***. ******. Alright. Is this for [REDACTED]? Irene I would assume I don't have the address in front of me. I can check on that, but uh, Irene is the is the woman's first name. I can dig second name out. OK. Irene, OK, yeah, that, no, that, that matches up. I just wanna make sure I have the right thing pulled up. Me too. So the main question is I was looking for, did you, where is kilowatt hour output generated by the solar found? Do you have that? Is that, is that a remote access you have on that? Yeah, so, uh, let me check. I think it's in her lease agreement. Double check here. Uh, yeah, yeah, so it's on page * of her lease agreement. The, the Uh, what, what is on page *, the, the guarant well, does it get the guaranteed that what you mean? Yeah. So the, but the question I have is what is the output right now uh the system with the, uh, real, the house is being sold. That's why this is coming up right now and the real estate agent wants to look. OK. Yeah I got you. OK, so you. Went to look and could not find an output that showed the kilowatt hours generated by the solars to date. Got you. So, uh, the, the. So is that is that something that you monitor? Yes, the customer also has access to that as well, so she could view it, uh, and provide that. OK, uh, where, where is that found at, at, at the house? It's uh it's through an online portal it's called the customer portal, so she could log in and and see all that information. Oh, so it's, it's, it's a remote access. Yes sir. OK, can you tell me then? I don't know, I, I, I don't have the login credentials. Is that in the con I have the contract actually with me is, is, is the login credentials in the uh contract? No, so that would be, uh, the, the, the customer would have those, those credentials. So, um, I am slightly limited to the amount of information I can give to somebody not related to the account, um, I guess my next kind of question would be like kind of like who are, who are you in regards to the to the customer that we're, you know, under contract with. I didn't see it offhand. Well, I guess So, so I'm, I'm an engineer, she consulted. An engineering consultant, OK. So Got you. I, I, I, yeah, but I actually worked in the utility industry all my, my entire career, so. Got you. Yeah, so I wouldn't, I can't provide her credentials because I can't see them, uh, so she, she sets up her password and all that on her end. Well, can you tell me how much, how, how can you tell me the kilowatt hours per year then? is that information you can give? Yeah. That should be fine. Let me pull up our system here. So do do do. All right. Last year the system produced *.** megawatt hours. That's up there. And uh just out of curiosity, it's, it appears that she pays, I, I know she pays you at $**.** dollars ** cents a month for the lease on that. The, the, do you also get to, do you get part of the Yep. So is, is, is she then on on on uh net billing net net metering where, whereby she just puts the power out in the meter back backwards. Mm Yes. Well, I don't know if she's on net metering or on like a buyback. It depends on her specific local utility and, and what their solar plans are, um, but she's on whatever, she should be on whatever solar plans available there. OK. That's it's Pico. So it's Philadelphia Electric Company. Do you, do you know offhand what they their fan would be? Uh, I can, I can check. I think I have a Pico bill here. Let me see what they do. Pico, uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure Pico's Netmeter it looks like, but you have to double check to see because it is, it kind of depends like when she signed up and what program she's under and stuff. I'm pretty sure Pico does Net me now. Uh, one follow up I know I, I noticed going through her contract that she had a guaranteed rate of return on the first year. Yep. And did she make that guarantee or did was that ever validated and then Yeah, so that's only uh typically done upon request, so she not sure let me see if we have anything. For her Mm. Yeah, it looks like we did do one for. Uh, almost a year ago now. Uh, let me see. That'd be about right because it was installed in **. Yeah. I, to be precise, was April **th, ****. Mm.

I don't see where she posted the actual results for it, but since there's no credit or anything attached, I would assume that uh they did determine that she saved some form of money. So as I read this and so it's it's. Um yeah it looks like that was done about a year ago. Actually it's, it's this is pretty close to what you see what did you project? Uh. Looks like it's pretty close to what you projected offhand. Yeah, so actually it looks like it actually produced more than projected. Looks like it's like year * or *, it's more in like the * megawatt range, whereas last year produced produced * megawatts, so it looks like it produced produced more than we guaranteed. Don't have that So I, you guaranteed around *, well, you, about ****, actually **** kilowatt hours, which is, uh, * megawatt hours. So this is, it's pretty so the *.** would be just about. No. Let me take that out. Make sure I'm on the right one here. So like mine had a little different number than you were mentioning there. I'm, I'm going to get, I have the contractor and to get it real quick. Yeah, the one I'm looking at is, is, uh, **** kilowatt hours. It's only guaranteed in year two. That that's the guarantee, but you also did a predict you also did a prediction and so I think you're close to the prediction. No. Oh, we don't want the prediction, got you, got you, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, it's somewhere else in here. I got you. Yeah, the prediction is a little different, um, yeah, we'll we'll, we really go off of the, uh, is the guarantee, uh, that's part of the lease agreement we make, we guarantee it'll produce, uh, at minimum, uh, at that level. That's that's what you, that's what you, that's what you care about for sure, yes. So it's really it's it's minimal, uh, I guess her, her net income because she's paying you $** a month and she's getting like maybe $** a month. She's on on on her savings on electric bill. Actually, I like your front page. Your front page is a nice summary. Got you, thanks. Uh, you know, Irene Webster. And there's this [REDACTED]. I got that here, Lafayette Hill. I know I found it when I read through it in more detail. Sure. Here we go. There's your guarantee there's, there's your guarantee **** KKW **** kilowatt hours. Yep But then you have the projection. But anyway, it, it, it met the uh it it met the the uh. The minimum, so well, she, she's over what you guaranteed. Correct. That's the bottom line. Alright, I guess that answers the question for now. Uh, but while I have you then if she so as I as I read this contract, she has or or the new buyer of the house would have uh three options. Option one is to would be to assume this this lease right now, correct? Yeah Uh, yeah, really it's mostly it's really, yeah, I guess three options, uh, assume the lease, pay for the removal, and cancel the contract, or if she's moving to an area that we install, we could move the system, but typically we try to avoid that option when possible. Yeah, I, I, I, that, that doesn't make sense, um. Yeah. But yeah, typically we do with one of the first two either either assume the remainder of the lease or pay the removal fee and kind of just end the contract. So yes, so I understand. So obviously if if the new buyer decides uh decides to, uh, assume the lease they would have to put a put a a new contract with you and really the main reason for getting this number is to show that there is, it doesn't make sense to pull it out because it. It's it's earning money compared right now to the lease amount $** a month. Correct, yeah, yeah, which is, you know, we, we don't really, uh, sell or install if we're not, uh, certain that it's gonna, you know, be a positive return or else it's just unhappy customers and, you know, things go go downhill from there, right? So, um, uh, but yeah, yeah, if you sell the home, the number one option is just to sign the lease assumption. All it is is they would have the exact same contract they would just assume the remaining term. Yes. I I And about how if if the new buyer chooses to remove it, about what's the cost? Yeah, let me check if they have it listed. It should be listed in here somewhere, or they may not have it in these newer ones actually, let me see. Uh, OK, it looks like you don't have it listed. Let me see if I can grab that price there real quick. Uh, Pennsylvania. By the way, how, how many KWs does you have installed there? Do you know, uh, what, what is the, uh, or uh. Yeah, I can. It's a *.* kW system. *.* KW OK. Uh, so the removal price. I'm the guide here one sec. Uh, it would be ****. ****. OK, that's that's that's fairly reasonable actually. Sure. All right, well, that's great. Uh, you've been through all my questions. Awesome. Glad I could help. And uh I do appreciate it right thanks now right. Perfect, yeah, you have a good one. Bye bye.

Is now a good time to go over some account information concerning your solar system? Oh, sure. Awesome. I also need to let you know this call is being recorded for quality assurance and training purposes, and I just wanted to extend a warm welcome to our solar family and to tell you a bit about Posogen.

Uh, I, I get phone. Got you. Thank you so much for confirming that information. Now, just to point out a few details regarding your account. I see here you have a ** year lease agreement with a monthly payment of $***.** each month, and that rate will stay the same for your entire ** year lease. And I do also see. Yes, and when did that begin? Because I still have a really big electric bill so far. So your system was just activated. * *nd. Well, it, you haven't seen a difference in your image bill at all since your system was activated in February the **th? No. OK. No. Wow, interesting. I would assume it's because we usually ask that you give it about ** to ** days from the date of activation to be able to see a difference on the next bill that you receive, you will see a difference. Since it wasn't last month. OK, and I, and I, and am I getting that bill from Atlantic City Electric then or from you guys? I'm confused. It's gonna be two separate bills. From elected from your elect. OK, so then that's my concern because I'm still getting a bill from Atlantic City Electric in excess of like *** to $***. Mhm. Mhm. And if that's the case, I mean that's, that's not saving me any money. Now I'm paying two separate bills and almost paying double. Yeah, I understand, um, but like I was saying, you know, we usually ask that you give it about ** to ** days from the activation date. Yours was February **th. It still hasn't been the ** days, so on the next bill that you receive, you should be able to see a difference on your energy bill, and then your lease agreement does guarantee um savings, so it just needs to some time to generate enough energy to be able to affect your energy bill.

If you have any questions or concerns in the future, you can always give us a call and we'll make sure that we take care of you. With whatever question you may have. OK, sounds good. Yes, ma'am.

Um, you will be receiving your first bill in the mail in about ** days, um, and on that bill will be account information that you can use to go on to passage and.com to access your billing information if you ever need to.

So that's the, so I got a call where they're saying that one of them was set up on autopay. I don't know which system that is. I'm trying to figure out what that one is. And then I got a statement saying that, and then I got a statement that it was $* that was gonna be deducted or I owe $* because it's not on autopay. So um I just I need clarification on all of that, on that those answers. OK. All right. All right. Let me verify then. So I got this account ending in ***. That account is current. This one is not, not on auto pay. OK, let me check the other one. It might take me a couple of minutes, OK? Cause I need to do one by one. Mhm, yeah, that's fine. Maybe you can start with the one that was just added because I think that probably would be the issue. Alright, let me see. So this one account number ending in ***, this one is not on autopay. Either Is that the one that, that was, that was the one that was just added or no? So I'm not able to tell which one was recently added. Let me see. Do you have the account number by any chance of that account? I don't, um, if you tell me the prices then I could tell you which one was just, which one was, I think it's the, cause it's like one that's **** and then there's like a ****, right? Yeah, so the one that I'm Or **** and **. The one that I'm looking right now, um, the payment, it's for **.**. So the last payment made was for March to pay two months, um. Yeah, so the other account. Let's see. So it's **** and the other one is **** or is it ****? The other one is **.**. OK, and that one shouldn't be on auto pay. So what's the next one? What's how much is that one? OK, let me check the other one. Give me a second. OK. Uh OK, so it looks like you only have * systems. Are you paying * accounts or just *? That's what I'm trying to figure out, man. Uh, I got * sisters. And I paid for *, but my opinion has the other one, so I'm trying to figure out is that one coming out separately on his account or what? Like that's what I'm trying to figure out with you. OK, let me see. Yes OK, because this thing is only showing me that you have two accounts, but one it says floor *, floor *, and I saw floor *, but it's not giving me the account number for **. How much is, how much is the *rd *? How much is the payment? It's not even, yeah, it's not even showing on my system. So give me a second. OK OK. Let me place you on a brief call, um. Huh? I can't hear you, ma'am. Let me place you on a brief hold. OK. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. OK. Thank you for the wait. I on the *rd account. I'm sorry about that. Alright, so the other account it looks at that it's for ****. Yeah, and this is the most recent one. OK, is that one set up for? Is that one set up on auto pay? Um, let me see. No it's not. It's not set so so it's not set up on auto pay. No, it's not. Because when they set up they told me that it was a card that was charged to that one so that's what I'm kind of confused with. Alright, so it's ****. Alright, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Um, let me see. This one has a balance of $*. Uh, I believe it's the non-ACH fees. So that one does have a, so that, so that's the one that, so that's the one, so it's $* this month and the next month is gonna be $**.** dollars. If you guys enroll on autopay, yeah, but the account has a, I think it has a late fee as well too. Let me check. This is your your tenants um account? No, so what I'm Yes, no, ma'am, just listen to me for a second. I got a bill saying it was $* but what I'm trying to figure out is because they, he just got it installed and they told me it's gonna take a month before it happens. So my question is, if it's $* the next month, the bill of ** $** is supposed to be due? It should be **.**, to be honest, but has the account has some fees here. So what I'm able to do is I can um. Waive the the non-ACH fees, but the account needs to be on roll on autopay because it's not, I mean, I can waive it, but you're still gonna have it for next month. I don't have none of them on ACH though, so I don't even understand why I have a balance. That's what I'm trying to say to you. My other two are not on ACH either. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, you don't have it. But the thing is like, for example, for the one that has the balance open for $* for the non-ACH, I can waive that non-ACH fee. But for next month, you're still gonna have that um extra $*. So my question is to you, OK, so I, I would appreciate if you could waive it. My question to you is, is it gonna be if I don't enroll in it, is it gonna be $** like $*** plus $*? Mhm. Yes, that is correct. It will be **.** cents because the regular price for that account is **.**. And adding up the $* yeah, it will be **.** cents. Yeah. OK OK, so my question to you, so. Was this just the $*. Yes. Guess what? It's only the $* the fee. OK, so that's why I need to come I finish. OK, thank you. You want to waive it or how, or you, were you guys? No, I, I would like for you to read it. I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it regardless. I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it regardless, you know, as a courtesy here, but I just advise to um. Thank you. Enroll it, so you have that uh you don't have that extra $* there. Thank you. OK. No, you're welcome. Just give me a couple of days because it needs to be adjusted, um, but yeah, I'm gonna submit the request to waive the fees for this month and next month. Mhm. OK, thank you. You're welcome.

Um, their main thing is getting the government funding and also, um, like local placement, uh, both jobs and student training, it looks like. Um, so the reason why theirs is ** years is because their template is for ** years versus our actual, which is ** years. Uh, we previously did ** years, um, but towards the end of. Actually I wanna say towards the middle of **** we started doing ** year leases. Uh, so I guess So I really just never updated their templates. It could be also that, um, a couple of the other installers that Solarice Philly works with, there's like * or * different installers. Could be a couple of the others use ** year leases. OK. So it's a it's a template difference um your actual lease is the posing portion since we're the ones that installed and we'll be uh maintaining, monitoring and sharing the system. OK.

f6beb635-16eb-4eb5-9029-3c63e1929c42,"Thank you for calling Posagger. My name is Tawanda. How can I help you? Right Yes, good afternoon. Hey, could you tell me, I was texted, I believe either Saturday or Sunday that I was supposed to have a technician to come out here to my house today. Could you tell me, does he intend showing up or is it just like everything else and everything's just Yes It. Uh, that. Whatever. Alright, I can certainly help you with that. Can I have you verify the name, address, phone number, and email? Yes. Janet, J A N E T C U C C I A [REDACTED] and JA all lowercase, JA crumbles@yahoo.com. Thank you. Let me check on this for you. Mhm. Oh Alright, so it does look like they have someone scheduled to come out today. I don't see that it's been canceled. The job is still open. They haven't started anything yet, but we do have you scheduled for today. OK, it's supposed to be for today. Do you know about what time? I have, have put, I've put everything on hold waiting for these people and it's just like normal. It's just not worth two dead flies and a bowl of sour milk. I've had these things. It's Oh. I do apologize, ma'am. I've had these things for * years, and that's * years are the worst years of my life, you hear. Mhm. They are not worth the powder to blow themselves to hell with, and I'm sorry, I'm, I'm doing it to you just like everybody else, but everybody that knows me knows that they're gonna hear it because they're not worth the money that I'm having to pay for them. Yes, ma'am. Mhm. OK, so can I ask you, is your system behind a locked gate? No. OK. So if you do have to leave, you you certainly can. They don't need to get into your home. Everything they have to do is on the outside. I know. I want to be here. I want to be here. But if you want to be there. OK. Well. I do because, like I said, everybody has ever come before, um, the same thing. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Mhm. Mhm. Um Oh OK. I do apologize that you've experienced that, but they are scheduled to come today. You know, but you know, if you could. I don't know if you. I don't know if you guys are still understaffed or what. Are you all still understaffed? Not that I'm aware of, no, ma'am. Not, Are you new? No, I'm not. What No, you're not. Is, is Beth Elizabeth there? Is her, well, I think her name was Elizabeth, or could you see who uh I had talked to the last time I was there. I, I spoke to somebody and she was really, really nice. No. Mhm. And I mean, not, I'm not saying you're not now, please. Excuse me for saying it like that, you know, but, uh, she really, she tried to help me too, you know. So, but, you know, my biggest problem is that I've got to pay you guys $** a month to get a $* kickback. Mhm. Mhm. Something's wrong there. Well, What you're getting on your light bill, the credit on your bill is basically anything that you did not consume, so you're saving when you use your panels during the day, everything that your panels create, you run your home off of that so you're not buying from the utility company during the day, so you won't see that on your light bill. You only see anything that you didn't consume on the light bill. Well, they're telling me ever since I've been here that these things are not working properly, ever since I've had them up, honey. They've never been, they've never been pro. Mhm. Well, we do have someone. We have someone coming. They're scheduled to come today. And they will take a look and see what they can find out. OK. OK. OK, and I do see that Elizabeth did put a credit on your bill for * months, so. OK. Because, let me, let me Right, right, right. You know, and, and that's what I'm saying. I mean, that, now it looks like from what, uh, I don't know what date probably in just some time this month, probably I'm gonna start getting a $** bill, uh, and a bill from you guys again, correct? Well, let's see what you have. Yeah. That was back in December. So you got January, February and March, so April you would start to receive a bill again but once we find out what's going on, if it's for any reason that they can't fix it today, we can certainly apply another credit. Thank you. So it's not just because that credit is over, you don't, you don't, you start to build. If it's still not fixed, we can do another credit. OK. Because OK. Because like I said, you know, I, I, I've lost my job, and believe me, money is very funny right now. And $** doesn't sound like a whole hell of a lot, but I can't get a job anymore because of my age. Mhm. Mhm. You know, and, uh, if, if they can't ever fix these, can they take these things down? Yes ma'am. Well Can I cancel? That that's a, a long way off and I understand what you're saying, but I can't make that call, but we do have to fix it. It is in our, our lease the maintaining it, we have to fix it. So they will definitely fix it. Uh Mhm Oh Uh-huh. You have to fix it. Yes ma'am, that is part of our agreement with you. OK. Well, I sure appreciate it. At least the * months. I was glad for that. But you know, like I said, I still had the year and something else that they didn't fix it, you know, and these people, they would come out and they'd say, well, I don't see anything wrong. There's nothing wrong and all this, and Right. Mhm. Uh, uh, Doreen was the one I used to always deal with, and she said, oh, Miss Janet, she said, I am so, so sorry, you know. And, but she, she knew, she knew the problem that I had, you know, but I never got a credit for those for that either, you know? And like I said, hey, $** doesn't sound like a whole hell of a lot, but it is when you don't have the money, you know. Yeah. Mhm. Right. Right. So, but, um, you know, like I said, I'm, I'm so sorry to be ragging you out and this is the first time I've talked to you, you know. That's fine. You're OK. I understand, but. So Mm, please accept my apology, you know, but like I said, you know, when you're paying for something and you know, it's not working. Right. You know, you're, you're not a very happy king of all. I understand. You know, But there should be someone coming out there today to take a look and see what we can find out and how to proceed from there. So. OK. OK. OK. About what time would be the latest that these people would come out here? I spring. Well, let's see. Would you be able to give me like a time frame? Well, I do know they're coming from uh the New Orleans area. So it's gonna be a, a nice ride. What I know that too. I know exactly where you guys are. I know what Saint James Drive, um, I know where James Drive is in Saint Charles Parish. Yes, I do know, I know it very well. Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. I used to live, I used to live in Mantaray. Mhm. OK. So it's about a two-hour drive, uh. Yes. I would say at least give them to at least. Yeah * OK Because we do time windows, not necessarily one specific time. Mhm. Yes, yes, yes, I understand, but they, they had said, they, you know, about *:**, and I was thinking *:** would be about the latest, you know. Mhm. So when they say *:** that's that kind of starts your time window. So. Hello? That starts your time window *:**. Mhm Oh, that starts, that starts my time window. I thought, you know, maybe from the time from the, from the morning to *:**, so from *:** to about *:**. Yes, ma'am. Mhm. I would say give it to at least *:**, yeah. OK. And then if they don't call, and they don't come, do I call you guys? OK. You can certainly call us. Back or I don't see anything saying that it was canceled, so it it's still on for today? So we, we just have to give them time, you know, they do other jobs and * may have run a little over, so we have to, that's why we have those windows instead of just one specific time and we have to account for traffic as well. Mhm. OK OK. OK. OK. OK. So, well, like I said, I'll give them till about *:**, you know, I mean, which I can't make my run because it's already too late by then, you know. But, um, if they, they don't, uh, OK. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. Uh, I wanna find out because I have to make this call for tomorrow. I have to do it. And I, like I said, I would, I want to be here when the technician comes out. Yes. Right. Right. I understand. Exactly I do want to be here because the last one that came out, he just about told me he didn't know what the hell he was doing. He told, just about told me that. Oh Mhm. That's how bad it was. Well, hopefully we get some answers today and it's, it's to your liking and we can get this resolved for you. Yeah, so, but everybody. Great, that's good. Oh, OK, OK. And like I said, hey, I'm really sorry to have dragged you out for this, but there again, I like what you said that if it's not resolved, that you all can give me credit again. Yes ma'am, we don't want you to pay for something that you don't have. That's, that's not part of the contract. If it's not working, we have to put you on uh some type of uh either deferment or credit to the account. And so. Mm. Yeah. Well So you're not paying for something that you didn't receive. And see how come they never did. How come they never did that before for me? They never did it before for me because like I, yes, yes, like I said, they could see that the system was not putting out. That I can't speak to. I, I can't speak for anyone else. Mhm. But they never ever gave me a credit for anything. Mhm. So, you know, so, but uh I'll wait and hopefully somebody will show up or at least call me today, have, have the common courtesy to call me if they're not gonna show, you know. Mhm. Right. And um so, you know, that's just that I, I don't know. I, I'm just, I'm just not happy with these solar panels. I'm really not. I'm really disappointed. I really am, you know. Well, hopefully we can turn that around for you and, and get this working properly. All right, honey. Well, thank you so much, OK? You're welcome. You have a great rest of your day. Thank you. OK, bye-bye. You're welcome. Bye bye.","Customer called to inquire about a scheduled technician visit.

4cfc303c-5916-4ea2-b67c-a7a3b90e5320,"Hello, how can I help you? Oh yeah, how you doing? I'm a um. I guess soon to be uh current customer for positing I was approved um to move forward but um. I am in second question about dealing with my uh contract and I'm thinking there with the with my situation so I I need to talk to somebody about that uh my contract. OK. OK, let me see, let me see if I, if I can help you out if I can help you out, we, we can uh we can uh direct you to your representative, but let me see if I can help you out. What's your phone number? Let me pull up your account. Because I don't, I'm, I'm really looking at. Uh, yeah, ***. Mhm. ******* All right, Keith. Yeah. Alright, OK, I have you pulled up. All right. OK [REDACTED]. Yeah. All right. Oh, so what, what questions do you have? Alright, so, Let me get, let me get this contract up that's what I was trying to do, um. First of all, my situation is, uh, I've been seeing that, um, in the state of Pennsylvania. Let, let me start off this way. When I first wanted to try to get sober, I looked into it through maybe my website of social media. There was a Mhm. Situation where they were saying that the state of PA gets a certain amount of money um that they give you for the solar and then there's the taxes that you. We'll get it back and also um some extra money of savings every single year. Mhm. Now withposits um that I'm realizing that I'm just leasing this, this, uh, stuff, uh, so and also I'm not getting anything back for taxes and also not getting anything at the end of the year or savings. I'm just paying a certain amount. Which is **.** close to $**.** dollars with the um. The bullies um of Pico cause they're never gonna go nowhere and uh Mhm. That's really the issue that I'm seeing that um. If if I wanna buy the soers down the line I can buy them, but. That Still It's not What I'm, you know. Seeing like I'm, I'm really not seeing anything as far as like I have, I, I wanna be able to do my taxes. I wanna be able to have a savings a little, you know, hey, $*** *** dollars, you know, at the end of the year each year, you know, you get money off your taxes too. I, you know, I own my own house, so therefore, you know, I wanna, I wanna be able to see a profit, um, then I could take the tax money and just keep paying off the, the solar, you know what I mean. Right. ***%. So, so, so Keith, so, so what you're looking for is, is to purchase the system, OK? Uh, when you purchase the system that's when you are able to, um, and I'm just being fully transparent with you, if you're able to then get the, the tax credit and all that stuff from it. Um, Every time I just But. Uh When you purchase the system, OK, so that's what you're looking for, um, you know, that's what the route I guess that you wanna take, um, which I can have your representative speak to you about that. I can have him give you a call if that's what you wanna just see what it looks like, um, but yeah, that would be, that would be the route you wanna take in order for you to take the benefit of the, you know, tax credit and all that good stuff. Mm. Oh, so with the representative guy that you know that I was dealing with, what he was saying, what he was saying was true is uh to to the certain fact of, OK, we, it's better for you to lease, and he's saying that you, you better to lease it out in your position or whatever because you know I probably couldn't get it through my um my credit. I don't know but um but I. Yeah. Right, so to purchase it, yeah, you do, you do gotta have a, uh, a credit score of between *** to *** and higher, um, and you also, in order to take full advantage of the tax credit, you gotta, you gotta meet the tax requirements. That requirement which is that? What is that? Mm, you, uh, you have to pay a certain amount of federal income tax, like, you know, when you work, you have a, you know, you get your W-*, you know, they take federal taxes, um, so like people that are retired or people that are, are, you know, have a monthly check, let's say like a disability check or Social Security check, those people won't, the, the purchase won't, uh, benefit them because they're not, you're not, you don't have the tax liability. Hm So as long as you have the tax liability, then, then you can lease, uh, then you can purchase, but that's why sometimes the lease is better uh because you won't even meet the, you won't even meet to get the tax credit. Oh, OK. Oh, OK, I see what you're saying. Mhm. Uh, yeah, OK, so that is making sense. In some sort of fashion, OK, so where, where my thing another thing, you know, then, now I understand that part. Alright, let's hit me with number *. Um, Yeah, right All right, let me, I'd rather, I'd rather answer, I'd rather answer all your questions right now, and I, you know, I'm, and like I said, I'm gonna be fully transparent, you know, it's not because I'm, I'm one of the project managers here, so my, my position is to be a voice for the customers with the company. So I'm always gonna be transparent like I just was now. I could have just been like said anything to you, right? But no, I'm, I gotta be transparent because hey, if you're meeting the tax requirement, yeah, if you wanna, you wanna get that go purchase it, but this is what happens, so I'm always gonna give you the pros and cons. No, no, it's not a bad thing. Now it's. Yeah. Right I Right, right, right, right, I hear what you're saying. Um, So, So go with your next question. Mhm. The second thing I realized was I, I, I, I have an EV car, right? Mhm. I have a a um electric car, right? And I know it's probably good for for the grid to. OK. Uh, whatever, but What I'm seeing now is that I'm gonna be really paying double for. Um, Not only the ** $** but I'm also gonna be paying another. $** or $** something dollars and it's still gonna be the same bill that I'm getting. Why do you say you're gonna be paying double? Uh, isn't it because I, I don't know why, but I heard that that's what I'm gonna be doing. Yeah, uh, let me see. Someone told me, uh, you know, exactly by looking at the numbers and they were like, you're gonna be paying for this and that. Um, let me see here. Let me take a look. And that's what I'm And because you're getting ** panels on your home. Mm. ****.*%. Mhm. Uh, blah blah blah blah. Yeah, I don't, I don't see where the $** would tap in, um, you know, of course, you will be paying your delivery charge and then whatever it's not covered by the solar. I'm trying to pull up your offsets not pulling up for me for whatever reason. Um, OK, delivery charge is that for the delivery of what? Yeah, that's, uh, your electric, your electric company we stay connected to the grid, so that's always gonna be a few dollars like anywhere from like $* to $* that we pay them regardless just because we're connected to the grid. Oh. So Um, and then when the, and then when your solar panels don't cover a huge, you know, ***%, then of course the remaining balance would be with, with your electric company. I'm just trying to pull up your offs and it's not pulling up for me for me to actually see what your. Yeah. What your system is gonna produce for you. Mhm. Um, but just so you know, and once I get it, if I get it pulled up, I can give you a call back, but just for like the simple, right, so let's say your solar system is gonna cover **% of your electricity and you're paying $*** you know that you will get the **% difference from the electric company. So then let's say you're, you are paying $*** and we're covering **%, and then you will see your bill, uh, with the $** of a difference for, for your electric company if you tap into that, right? Mm If your production, you know, let's say you lower your production or, or whatever, or now if you increase your production for what your panels are giving you, then yeah, you're always, that's why we stay connected to the grid. Um, but I can't speak, I can't specifically speak right now because I just can't see um what your system is producing. My computer is just not loading it, uh, for the system that they, that you signed up for. Mm. Um, OK, so call me back on that because that's like that is all. So Yeah, yeah, I can definitely follow up with you on that as soon as my computer wants to work. Alright, so, mhm. Mm. Yeah, I can as soon as it loads up I can give you a call and we'll discuss that. Alright cool but now what, what, another thing was um one more thing, and this is where I noticed. The default of you guys checking everything that needs to be checked on top of the roof. I told them that. The And I spoke to somebody and they said they were gonna call me back that the Panels, if you put them up and then Zoe in PA we get snow sometimes. Sometimes the snow accumulates on top of the panels. Mhm. OK, and there's no melting guard. Uh, I have a, a slant roof, and they noticed that, yeah, they do know that it's a slanted roof. Now they were going to change all the check the, you know, spotted roof to see what's going on, but they said everything's good with the roof. They're just gonna change the shingles. I have a contract right here that agreement where they was gonna tear off everything and da da da da da da da da, go through the process, na na na. Mhm. Um, Yeah, I know it's crazy, right? Now, now. Um, The problem was I told them that you know, recently I just said look, you know I got a slanted roof and I have a driveway where I keep my cars. I have a Tesla and I have a BMW, you know, I might switch to another EV car, but I'm sure it's gonna have a sunroof because we always like sun roofs. So, my cars are right there where the, the, the, the roof is, and I said, when snow, well, I, I let them know when snow drops down on the ground, it kind of hits the cars. Um, due to the fact. And I said y'all should have a a a a guard. A guard up there, man, because, um, a melting guard where it stops that snow from dropping like that, you know, whatever the case may be, um, the guy said, he said, you know, normally y'all don't do that. I would probably have to pay for it just then the blah blah blah, but he said, well, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get back to you and I'm gonna see if we can look into the budget. Whatever. I said fine. Do what y'all got to do, but to move forward. I'm not trying to have this crump of snow sliding off. The, the roof went, you know, it doesn't slide when you have the um the panel, I mean the um. The uh uh uh the singles up, it never slides, you know, you might get a little bit, you know, and it might fall, but it's not rock hard, but those panels I noticed are they are they are, I know they're slippery, and when that snow hits up there, it's coming right down. Mhm. Um, Whatever, whatever the case may be, sometimes it sticks and sometimes it doesn't, but when it does stick, what's gonna happen is, and if it gets thick, I say give us about ** inches, maybe *, you never know, we don't get that, that much bad snow now, but sometimes, you know, Philly is, is unpredictable. So when that snow gets a little thick and it stays up there, it gets hard. And when it gets hard, it turns into a brick. Yeah, so I'm, I can, I can only speak from experience with you. Uh, I would note, I'm gonna notate that and and talk to them about and see what they tell me. Um, I live in New Jersey, OK, so I, I get, I get a fair amount of snow. Um, has not had, um, and I'm only saying by experience, I don't know your pitch of your roof, so I, I'm not saying that. So, I said to myself, Oh Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I just want to give you that little bit of peace of mind. I do have solar in my home right now. Uh, my car is the same way. My cars are right underneath the driveway where my main panels are falling down. It has not happened yet for me. It's been * years. Has not happened yet, OK. Um. Right. It hasn't, it hasn't, uh, I have a slanted rule. Yeah, mine is really like they didn't even want to put so at first because I slanted my, my pitches. Yeah You have a slanted roof? Do you have a s OK. Um, but the only thing I say is, yeah, cause it's slanted. It's really like, really, and I'm glad it's over my garage area because if you think about it, how slanted it was on a, like if it was in a in a bedroom area, I would've, I would have, it would have been like an attic. Um. Right. Anyway, uh, hasn't happened yet, right? Like I said, um, hasn't happened yet, not saying that it can't happen, right? Um, but I will talk to them about that, but just to show what I've seen is when my panels, when it's on my panels, um, because the panels observing the heat right from the sun, right? The, the UV rays, right? Um, it's not, it's not absorbing the sun, it's not absorbing sunlight. It takes the, the UV rays. Um, with that being as warm when my snow is on it, it, it's literally like Oh Mhm. Right, right. Melting it. So when I see it's like it was my, literally it'll just stay right on the edge, which is very weird. It'll stay right on the edge of my roof, um, without, yeah, without falling down. And if it does start falling down, it's just water dripping down. That's how my experience has been. However, like I said, I, I will speak to them. I will let them know that's one of your concerns and see what, see what they tell me. Oh wow. Mhm. We Oh. Yeah. Yeah, OK, alright, so let me ask this, are you with posit? You, do you have this, this solar panel? I am. I am with Positon. Oh, you do have them. So how, how, how, how are you, uh, uh, are you happy with it? Yes. I'm happy with it and I'm not saying just because I work here. um, I'm, I am happy with them, right? It's not, it hasn't been, haven't had a bad experience, you know, as of yet, and I'm knocking on wood. Hopefully I don't. Um, I know that once my panels, when they first installed my panels, um, I had a little leak. Um, they came the next day, fixed it, fixed my roof, put panels, haven't had a problem since, um, so. Uh, do you have Right. Oh wow. Oh wow. So far so good for me. OK. Cause I, cause I'm, I'm not being negligent. I'm not trying to see negligent about this. Um, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to just get information, um, about the panels because I was. No, OK, listen, I get it. Your home is your investment. Uh, your home is your investment. You don't wanna just throw anything up there. You don't want, I get it. Especially not on your Tesla. Oh Yeah, I was Yeah. Yeah, I was Yeah, yeah, I was totally interested in posing and then I also told them that I wanted to uh be a worker, uh, uh, be for you guys far as, um, with, with, uh, one of the representatives did come into people homes and try to, um, that. Mhm. Them know what Positing uh was was doing positively or uh for people if you know if they were interested but it just I, I told her I said that's what I wanted to do so I guess I'll put in um application with you guys and whatnot and try to move forward um and whatnot um. Yeah, definitely. And another way for you to earn money for right now if you know you submit your referrals through the passage and mobile app, you know, right now, even just for somebody sitting with an appointment, right, just for them sitting, uh, taking the appointment and just sitting with us, us letting know what we can do for them, whether they take it or not, you get $*** for that, you know. So and if they do install you get you get another $***. Yeah Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. Exactly, but you know what, another. Exactly. And it was really no way really, another thing I was trying to do that on social media and, and whatnot, but I noticed that you guys don't give us a code and it's harder to, how can I put it, to, to You don't have the mobile app? I have the mobile app, but it's, but it, but it's not. Yeah, so It's, it's, it's OK, so I don't know how that works because it's like, OK, say someone is interested, they see the app um and whatnot. What, how do they y'all identify this? They say, oh this was uh Keith, this was. So you So you have to submit it through your apps so you have to get their information. Exactly. You have to really represent in, in, in information and call the people and let them know. Yeah, that's So all you gotta do is somebody's available. No, somebody is available, right? Let's say somebody's somebody wants to hear it out, right? Let's say you put on your social media and somebody DMs you, Hey, look, I'm interested, you know, you get their first name, last name, their email, their phone number, the city and state, right? They don't have to give you the address right away if they don't want to. They can give you the city and state, right? And you submit it on your app and they go, it tells me that, hey, keep submitted it. Mm Mhm. Mm. Right. So it'll go right to your account, right through, yeah. Mhm. OK So you just go on the app, you click submit referral or add referral. You put the information like that, you submit that and it comes over to us saying hey, um, Keith Clax went ahead and submitted a referral. Sure, OK. Mm. Right, and how can I start, uh, like, like I'll put an application in for you guys, um, how do I put an application in? What, what is the, the website, just positing and then you go to careers. Go to yeah, go to Pogen.com and go to careers and see what, what, what you're interested in. Alright, I see. Alright, thanks a lot, and, and I, well, I'm interested in, uh, um, uh, uh, actually just doing what the other guy did, you know, coming into people, uh, and just. Yes, yeah, so so it's, it's called, it's called the res, right? Um, they'll come up as a res RES, uh, on Posaggen or be like a, um, um, outside sales representative. Just look for something like that, and that's what he does. So Uh-huh. Or renewable energy specialist, OK. So, uh, click on that and then yeah, put an application. It's a great, it's a great company, man. All right. OK OK, so can you. Uh Uh oh, I, I do know it. I, I, I've got, I'm gonna be honest, I, I, I, uh, I guess I, I kind of like saw you guys this has been so this process has been about maybe almost a year. I've seen a couple of people the *st, *st last year and then this year I've seen, you know, the guy that came to my home or whatever the case may be. So I already talked to people, sat down with them and we say, and I was very, very interested through other companies that I did pursue and I, it said, look, let me see who's the best, and I realized that Positgen was given the best um out of all of those companies and whatnot. Um, and the. Only thing I didn't understand was the money that PA was supposed to give us. In other words, uh, they, they were telling me on social media that, you know, they give you money. $****. But the guy was telling me that that money is for the panels, Keith. Mm. Right. Right? He was, well, I don't know how it goes. Right, yes, it's only when it's only when you own the system, it's only when you own the system that it goes to. Ah, OK. Mhm. Alright, so let's let's see if we can try to own the system because so I, because I wanna try to put it in my wife if that's the case, if, if can my wife do it? Yeah. I mean, yeah, is she on the title of the home? But Um, She in the title in the home? No, she's not. But yeah, I gotta, I gotta ask because I think if she, if you guys are legally married we can we just add you as a secondary. Um, Nope, she's not. Yeah, we Yeah, we're, we're legally married. Yeah, um, I. So, and she has. Credit is better than mine, so at this point, you know what I mean, I gotta build, I gotta, I gotta build my credit back up. Yeah. OK, got you, got you. So Yeah, so that's what I, I was like, look, you know what I'm saying, that's on the panel so we could get, get our, our money back and then we could see throwing that money on top of the, uh, the bill. Pay up, you know, You don't get paid off, you know, I don't know how that works, but it is what it is. As long as she meets the tax credit requirement, then yes. OK, the tax requirements? All right. Mhm. Alright thanks a lot. I do appreciate it. What's your name again? All right. My name is Oscar. Huh? Oscar. Awesome Alright, uh, thanks, thanks a lot for the information. Uh, all right, brother.

Hi, someone just called me from this number about my uh bill being paid. OK, I can definitely take a look. My name is My name is Joe Gilad G I L Y O T. All right, and what's your service address? [REDACTED]. Alright, um, yeah, so it looks like you have a payment that was due. Would you like to get that scheduled today? It's already been paid. Oh let me take a look at it. That's probably why she discon oh you sent it out via mail or how did you make the payment? It was uh Paid through Chase to be delivered by ** and my wife spoke to someone named Chanel on */**. Alright, no problem, um. It is a problem because y'all keep calling me asking if I'm gonna make a payment and it's like, could y'all keep up with y'all system? So let me, wait, listen, listen, let me, let me, let me explain something, and I understand, you know, the frustration behind it. However, when you pay through bill pay, that does take a while because your bank has to process the payment from your account. Then it has to be processed through our, uh, you want your bank cut the check, then a check has to be sent to our billing processing system, and it's a whole process and it takes a while. So, when your, when your wife spoke to Chanel, that may have in fact been um the payment for. So it was supposed to have been delivered on */*, today's **. And like I said, it's a process so the system may have not updated it yet so I'm not sure if that. So what's what system is supposed to update what system? Well, it's, it's a whole billing system that I, I don't see the information. I can check to see. But you all get the information to call me about a payment, but you don't get advice you don't get information that the payment has been made. I see, I see. Mr. Joseph, uh, look, uh, and that's not what I said. What I said was that's a whole billing, uh, it's another billing. It goes to the, the billing that's on your billing statement. That's where it gets processed at. We're in a whole another office. We're in Saint Rose, Louisiana where you send your bills at that's in Texas. So no, I cannot see when your payment arrived in Texas and when it gets processed, but once they process it in our system, then we can see it, but like I said it. And I understand all that, but the problem is they send you on this mission. Why? Mm, and I understand that and that's just, that's just what we have to deal with, you know. See, and that's what I'm saying, they sending you on this mission and you're blind and then you catching that smoke from me over this foolishness. I mean, it ain't no smoke. I don't, I don't want no smoke. I don't, I don't want no smoke. Cause after all those months it took to get this stupid system. What you need to understand, it took almost ** months to get the system fixed when it broke. So yeah, I got all the smoke for positgen. Just don't give it to me. Just don't give it to me. I got all the smoke cause y'all sure like to call behind some foolishness about a bill, but then it took ** months to get the system fixed. And look, And, and I understand your frustration, but at the end of the day, you know, you know. And I'm still waiting for my average billing with uh energy to stabilize. So I'm still paying more on my energy while it's still retabilizing for when that system didn't work for ** months. So yeah, I got all the smoke for posy and with the foolishness. Let me see. No, and I, and trust me, I, I completely understand, you know, I'm not against how you feel, you know, I will feel the same way, so I, I get it, you know, but at the end of the day, you know, the lady who called you, like you said, uh, in the account, the the the payment hasn't posted yet, so that's why she was giving you a call. It was just a courtesy, a courtesy call. Um, I'll let her know that you called back in to let, to let her know that uh you have sent the payment out and it was supposed to be delivered on the *th. I will let. Her know that um in the meantime, far as the bills, I can definitely take a look at that and see what's going on, make sure you're getting yourself back, but I do know since we did have those winter uh days that was uh from December to now, there was gonna be not much of a change in your bill, but now that it's getting back hot and the sun is starting to come up, you're gonna be getting more usage out of your solar panels because you do realize that, you know, you get more of your energy from the sun. And that's how you, you know, produce your savings and stuff. So now that we don't have any more, you know, memorial winter days, those have passed, you should definitely start. Sweetheart, sweetheart, you're talking to a retired physics teacher. I understand what we're dealing with. I'm not saying you don't understand, but I've tried to explain it as much as I could. So don't, don't, don't go through, don't, don't, I know, but I've already had these conversations. I understand darling. Mr. Joseph, I'm just doing my job. Don't, you don't, you don't have to, you know, you know, don't, don't do that to me because I'm only, you know, just trying to do my job and some people don't understand, so it's my job to explain it.

This is the rally with Passage and Solar on a recorded line. Yeah. Yes, sir. I was calling to introduce myself. I'll be your main point of contact for your project. And I'm gonna be following up biweekly, and I just wanted to know, how would you like your uh project updates sent to you. Some customers prefer email, others text. How do you prefer? You can text and email, there's no problem. OK. I, I can only, the system only allows one or the other, which, which one is best for you? You can text it. Text it? OK. So I'll go ahead and I'll text you my name and number just in case you have any questions uh before the update. And let me take a quick look and see where we're at with your project currently, OK? OK. And while I'm pulling that up, let me ask you, do you have the passagegen app by any chance on your phone? Uh, I downloaded but I didn't sign into it yet. OK, so what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead, I can send you a link that will make it easier for you to actually, it, it collects the data and it, it should have you uh log in quicker. Um, what kind of phone do you have, an iPhone or Android? iPhone. That one. OK. So on there, you're gonna be able to um see the project status. Uh, also, you're gonna be able to see um your, your billing statement in the future if you need uh to see that. And any payment that Posen uh sends you uh for referrals will be through the app only, OK? You do have to attach the bank account that you wanted to transfer. Um, OK, so you. OK. So currently it looks like we have the site survey scheduled for tomorrow between * and *. And basically, the um the technician will go out there, take a picture of the area that we're working in, bring that back and that's how we're gonna design your plan. And with those plans, we'll go ahead and get the engineer to stamp, OK? OK. All right. Um, do you have any questions for me? Um, no, ma'am. Um, one thing I did. Uh, Mhm. When they was reading it, they said that this is like not a replacement for energy. So if I'm not conserving. If I'm not putting out the energy. Um, That's just say After * or * months, * months down the line, and I'm not putting out the energy and I'm still getting a bill from energy and you guys, what, what, what happens then? So, uh, so the idea, so you're always gonna have a bill with uh a utility bill, that's, that's going to Right. Happen, um, because no matter what, unfortunately, uh, utility companies have to exist unless um something strange happened, but that's they just have to exist. We have to pay for the, you know, you're their service, a pole, a meter clock that you have to tie it into it. Um, now it's the only way, and I'm not sure if your salesperson explained this, but It is the only way to not depend on them ***%. It's, that's the only way because you're gonna be producing some of the energy that you're consuming, OK, that you're using. Um, now, if you use more, then at that point, that's where they're gonna bill you. So let's just say, and and just customers have to be aware of this, but you can't add a heated pool. Uh, because he size you without the heater pore, you see. Um, if you, if you add anything that's gonna take more energy, you're gonna need more panels. So, um, Right. That's, that's the thing, you just gotta be mindful that they size you based on what, how much energy you consume, you use now. The the idea of the panels and the only reason you someone go solar is to reduce their utility bill, right? And the only way to do that is by making your own energy. And the only way to make your energy is to have panels, um, but you just gotta be mindful, you can't just Use more than we make. Um, when you, when, uh, when they turn on your system, Basically, at the last step when they turned it on, turn it on. You're gonna get a call from our company and they're gonna provide you a link to monitor your system to take a look at how much you use, like how much are you making, how much energy, and you can base that and then look at your utility bill. Um, am I using more than I'm making? This is well, how much am I, you know, extra I'm using, so. That's how that works, yeah. I hope I, did I answer your question or did I not? Yeah, you, you did. OK, OK. Yeah. So you just like be mindful or just don't consume. I mean, the whole idea is uh to save you money on your utility bill. Um and like I said, it's making the energy you're using those, those panels, but if you overuse then at that point, yeah, you're gonna have a, uh, you're always gonna have an electric bill because of the meter, you know, that's, that's, that's the utility's property, um. And they're gonna charge you for it. That's just how it is, but yes, we're guaranteeing you a whole, uh, you know, after the year, um, you can have our office uh run a savings analysis and they will look at your utility bill, look how, how much, um, our panels, you know, produce, and then if they, if they didn't produce more than, you know. Then what we told you, if they don't produce what what we told you, they'll they'll credit you. They'll they'll they'll pay you out. OK. OK. All right, sir. So, um, need anything else? No, ma'am. I'm fine. That's it. OK, sir. So I'll go ahead and I'm gonna text you my name and number, like I said, um, I'm gonna text you the, the, the passage and app also. And if you have any further questions in the future, just give me a call or um you can text me, OK? OK, and what you say your name was? Uh, it's Ali, Ali. Oh, really? Yes. Yes, sir. Oh, alright. And I'll, I'll text you the spelling. OK. OK. All right, sir. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day, OK? OK, you do as well. Bye bye.

OK, so let, let's just go straight to this account. So, um, my name is. I have my wife on the line. She's charity, um, we're having a bit of a concern. me Uh, we have a contract with Passaging, and I believe it's a legal contract. I signed for it because it was, um, the information on there was clear. Um, I was supposed to get my roofing done, my garage roofing and the whole house roofing repaired. That was what was stated on the contract. And um I signed for it because it looks good. So they've come in to fix the roofing on the garage. And I tried, um, so when I was speaking to the contractor about it. He was not aware of the fact that he was gonna do the house too, so I put out a contract. He took a picture of it, spoke to somebody and said they will come back and fix it. I said, all right. So they went ahead and finished the garage routine and I waited I waited for some time. It's not yet come to finish up the on the house roof yet, but they've come to install the panels which I'm very grateful. Only for somebody to call me later on to try to explain to me that that is not what was on the contract. And I said no, I can read and I can clearly understand everything that is in there. It said the whole house repair roofing repair, chimney flushing and all of that. And he was trying to um tell me that um it was only the garage that is gonna take the panel so it's only the garage will see that they will do. So I didn't, I didn't like I didn't quite get it well. I tried to speak to Byo today and I'm kind of frustrated about this whole thing because that wasn't how it was explained to me too so I said no let me speak to customer service and see what can be done about it. If nothing is done, I would also like to speak to the legal people because this is not good. And I don't understand why the guy was trying to tell me that it was only the garage. Meanwhile, the whole thing said the whole house roofing there. And, and it even says it on the invoice. That whole house included, like this is written on the invoice that they charged to him. So we just didn't understand where the confusion was coming from. So it's the work that was um that was charged in the invoice. Done or I'm sorry. Hello? Um, the document that they send you, that's the invoice for the work that the workers are supposed to come and do, right? Yes. OK, and then they came, however, they only did part of the work, and they're telling my husband that, hey, like we're not supposed to do the main house. My husband's like, well, that's a miscommunication because I'm looking at this invoice and it says the whole entire house. So I don't know why you guys are just doing the garage. And leaving the house roof. Like that's not how it was explained to me, that's not how it's written in this document, and then they're like, well, take it off the posit and it's not really our problem. So that's kind of what brings us to you. Of a contractor Contractors Yeah, sorry, it's really hard to hear you. I think you said the contractor. I, I said it because of something the contractor stated. Yes, yes, and somebody called me after. I don't know who that is, probably the boss of the contractor, somebody tried to tell me it was only the garage room, but it stated in the contract that the whole house too. OK. Mhm So I just wanna get this situated so um I don't have your your account pulled up. I was, you know, the, the, the woman that transferred the call to me from a different department did give me the address which she did say **, uh, she said [REDACTED], um, and do you have your account number by any chance or a phone number that is associated with the account?

What I'm trying to get clarity on. OK. One is, is, um, the, the seller doesn't have the funds so what we're trying to do is just um kind of pay everything out of her proceeds that active sale um and have it kind of go to escrow account to pay y'all um for then the buyer can get the things done is that OK or does it have to be do y'all have to be paid before active sale? Right. So the way that it typically works still is that we would have to receive payment in full or we could actually receive partial payment with approval like if you wanted to just pay um the removal and then we could pay for the reinstall it at at that point whenever you know just basically split it in half, but as far as receiving an escrow or promise to pay to pay, um, I haven't seen that before. I haven't seen that been processed with us before. Well, it, and we're not looking at it being done before active sale we're looking at it all being done after the active sale, so you just need payment before it's actually done. Mhm, yeah. So basically the the payment for us is that it has nothing to do with the sale of the home. It's basically for our technicians to be paid for the truck roll to go out and do the job. So whenever they're ready to move forward with that work, um, we, we can hold that invoice until the sale is completed if you want funds are released and then submit payment at that point. But, um, as far as I know our process is that the invoice would have to be paid for us to schedule the removal. As far as scheduling goes, I know we're about * weeks out. Got it. So, so if, if the actual removal, the actual removal is not planning to happen until after active sale, then you just need payment before it's actually scheduled and done. It doesn't really matter whether it's before or after. You just, you won't actually do anything until you receive the $**** kind of thing. Mhm. That's it. That's it. Yes, ma'am. OK, so it could ultimately be done after the active sale. You can receive the payment after the after active sale and then remove the panels, um, what. Yep. Mm Does it matter at that point I guess if, if the, because then the property would be under the new buyer's name and not the current seller, you know, the current seller's name as far as contract wise, but. No, not necessarily, as long as if, yeah, yeah, if the seller, you know, wants to share access to the invoice or or ask it to be reissued, that's totally fine. Y'all can still do it as long as you get the money. OK. There's no stipulation. OK. Perfect, perfect. OK. That's where we wanted to get clarity on that, um, because we're, we're negotiating going back and forth with this, but the seller just doesn't have all the funds that they're wanting and can't replace the roof. So we're looking at doing it at the active after the active sale, just put in the money and taking it out of our proceeds, and then the buyer would have the funds to do it and to do the solar panels and then put the new roof on. So, um, OK, perfect. And you said your name was Joanne, correct? Sure. That's right, yep. Thank you so much Joanne for your help I greatly appreciate it. You're welcome, Joe. I hope you have a good one. You also bye bye. Right.","The customer called to inquire about the process for paying for solar panel removal and reinstallation after a home sale.

76324cee-0641-4507-afbb-33d9c02339a4,"Thank you for calling Imposit and Solar. This is Christian in customer care. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? OK, Christian, this is my *rd time I'm calling you guys and they're hanging on me. I don't know why. But I'm having a problem with my, for my, you know, the, the mirrors they're putting in my basement. They go straight up to my, for my um electric box. Mhm. The cables they put around the thing straight up to my, to my uh electric box, they corrode it like they're broken. OK. Yeah I need to send somebody to check it out and fix that because you know this is the *rd time I'm calling you guys and they're still hanging on me, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, absolutely. What's your, what's your address? My address is [REDACTED]. Got you. And you said this was done during installation? Mhm. Yeah, in the basement. OK. Cause I was cleaning the basement. I, I checked the cables, they go against the wall, and they could over it, you know, like, you know, they got like a white powder, you know, I don't know what's going on. I'm not touch. I'm living like that, you know. Gotcha. Gotcha. OK. Mhm. Got you. And these are the, these are the wires that go, are these the wires that go directly to your breaker or are these the wires that are going to, to the solar system? Mm They're going to the solar system to my, to my um um electric box too, and I got all the issue. OK. I have a beer from Pico to $***. Got you. Yeah, I have one. I got one other one they're coming too, the first one they come is **, like $**. And they come in this one too, ***. OK. From Pico. I don't know what's going on. I don't know, see, that's the problem over there. I don't know what's going on. For sure, OK. But I need somebody to come to checking it in the roof and checking the this the um the, the electric they do because something is wrong over there. I don't know. I'm not touching nothing. I'm seeing, but I'm living like that. OK. Actually let's see. OK, yes, so I see here it looks like the. Yeah, I don't know what's going on with my business like that, bro. Yeah, no, I get you. Yeah, so I was gonna say, I was gonna say so I can see, uh, it looks like the system is, is, is putting out fairly well, but what I can't see is the expected energy, right? So I can't see what the panels are supposed to be putting out, uh, in comparison to what they actually are, and that could have potentially something to do with that wiring issue that you're referring to and truthfully it could have a lot to do with your bill as well, um, if it's not putting out a maximum capacity. So. Excuse me? I know. OK, sounds good. I, uh, I opened up the the system damage case for you here just sounds like there might have been a wiring issue. Um, I'm gonna send that over to our home improvement team and have us come out and try to get everything rewired for you. Uh, did you have a specific day that you'd like us out? Hey, any day, but listen, I don't know what the be coming like that, too high. Got you, got you. OK, let's see. I never have a bill like that because I only paid you guys and this bill come starting came out. Right. Got you. From people. Yeah I need to somebody at least go in the, in the roof and check it out what's going on, what they, what they look like because you know what I'm saying? Nobody going in the roof. Yeah, no, absolutely. You know? Got you. Yeah, yeah, I was paying upfront, bro. I always get, you know. Yeah. Uh, these two big, bro, one that one almost $** and now this coming $***. Getting up there, it's getting up there fast. My you too because I need to, I, I, I pay you guys too pantopaganda. $** too, you know, this is a lot of money, bro. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. OK, I just, um, I just opened up that case and I sent it to our home improvement team. Um, I went ahead and let them know what was going on with the wiring, see if we could try to get it rewired. Um, I know you didn't give me an actual like a specific date or time, so I just let them know as soon as possible, try to get done as soon as possible. Um, there was, what'll happen is once they get that date they're gonna go ahead and shoot you a text, more than likely to confirm it. If that date works for you, then you're all good to go. If it doesn't, give us a call back so we can try to get you another date that works a little bit better for you. What do you think about the ***, the beers and the pickle? I was gonna say that's a that's a that's a lot. What I'm thinking is that that's probably directly in association with that wiring, um, so it would be kind of difficult, I guess to determine specifically what could be causing it until, you know, this, this problem is resolved. Um, is this the first bill that you've gotten that's, that's that high? Mhm. I know. Yeah, bro. Got you, got you. OK, yes, so I would say, um, for future reference, I mean, I, I we're looking at, let's see, I would say, I would say we try to get this addressed first, see if we can try to get this taken care of, and then once this is solved, um, if the bills. You know, I'm I'm gonna assume that the bills are going to go down. So assuming that they go down, they're all good to go. If not, then we'll have to kind of figure out if there's something else going on. But I'm thinking this is, this is going to fix a lot of the problems because like I said, I'm also not able to see the expected energy from the system. um, so I'm expecting that to fix this problem and more than likely fix your problem as well as far as the amount that's that they're charging. Mhm. Mhm. Mm. And now I need to you the guy to text me the day you come over here to check out what's going on and you wanna figure out what happened to the bill too. Yep, yep, absolutely. Yes, sir. So I was gonna say, so that's how we're waiting for, um, just waiting for that text and then once, once you get that text, then we can kind of move forward from there figuring out what's going on with the system and what's going on with those, with those utility bills, sir. Oh, OK, for now I need to wait for you to text me, yeah? That's it. It shouldn't take too long though. It looks like, I was gonna say it shouldn't take too long though. It's just a wiring issue. It isn't, you know, I, I'll be a little more worried if this was, you know, roof leak or something that might require an inspection. It shouldn't take, it shouldn't take too long. The number you call from, is that a good number for us to contact you on? The date you're available for? Mhm. Yeah, ***-*******, yeah. OK. OK, alright, sounds good. So I'll pass that over to him, um, have them, have them give you a call if, if they don't reach you over a phone call, have them shoot you a text, let you know what day we have in mind. OK, bro, thank you and have a wonderful day, bro. I appreciate that my man. OK. All right. Yes, sir. You too. Have a good one.

88d06df1-6f75-41f1-8fe3-fad2e80e6cb2,"Thank you for calling Pathogen. My name is Tawanda. How can I help you today? Hi, I'm just calling because um I just got off the phone with my electric company and they had brought up some concerns about the solar panels that I have. Mhm. OK, I can certainly help you. So, um, well, Yeah, they're just basically saying that it doesn't look like they're producing. Producing anything as far as you know, me getting like any free months or anything like that so they just, they kind of just raised the concern and I kinda want to see if there was a way to. Mhm. Possibly look into it or get somebody, you know, overhead in my address, you know, in my residence to come and take a closer look at it to see what's going on. Alright, I can certainly take a look and see what's going on. Uh can I have you verify the name, address, and phone number on the account? Yeah, Steven Brian. At [REDACTED] Athol, Massachusetts. ***** And the phone number is ***-***-****. Thank you and I have an email on file as SB as in boy ***.**@gmail.com. Alright. Thank you. Alright, just one moment, let me take a look and see what I can find out for you verify the system is producing. Mhm. So it does look like the system opened the case. So there is gonna be someone coming out to take a look and see what's going on because it's not uh sending us a signal. OK. OK. So it wasn't So they're gonna come out and see if it's not producing. Ah, OK. And verify what's going on and we from there we can figure out how long it's been going on if it's just that it's not sending a signal or if it's not producing. Mhm. Yeah. OK, cause that's weird because I, I. But there is a case open. OK, cause I did call maybe like. Maybe a few weeks ago because I was also having problems with, I, I think something surging in my house and causing my bill to be, my electric bill to be like astronomically high and the only Mhm. Uh-huh. Oh. Other things besides the solar panels that I've got put onto a house that's new, um, is, uh, central air or heat pumps. So, you know, those, the solar panels and that is the only additional big projects that, you know, use up my electricity that I've put into the house. Nothing's changed and we've been here for * years and Mhm. Mhm. Right. You know, since getting the solar panels and those heat pumps, I've been noticing that my bill is. It's just been going through the roof, you know, it's, it's literally like, it's literally tripling. It Mhm. You know, uh, like, you know, and so it's a little concerning because I'm trying to figure out where this is coming from, where the surges are coming from, because, like I said, the solar panels and, you know, my heating, those are the only two things that I, that are new in, in the house, you know what I mean? Mhm. Uh-huh. So did you get the So something's going on and I just Which did you get first, the panels or the, the heat pumps? Good. So I got the I got the the panels first. OK. Yeah, so I got the panels first and then I got the heat pumps put on because we have solar so that, you know, we're supposed to be a good kind of. Kind of compromise I guess, you know, seeing that because we have the solar panels and it's supposed to be saving, saving us money but we're not saving anything, so. Mhm. Right. I'm just trying to verify. We, we tend to, we were tending to. Yeah, because when I did call the last time, the person I talked to, talked to last time I said everything was fine, and this is maybe like * weeks ago, so. Because they Mhm. Mhm. I don't know how I don't know if that was true or not or what, but, you know. Yeah. Oh I, I like your answer better with that there is something going on and somebody needs to come out because I know I because I, I've been living in my house for * years and we, me and my wife both work from home so we're not really going anywhere so we, we're home, we know what we're running constantly and like I said, the only two new things that we put on the house, you know, for, you know, for upgrades was, you know, the panels and that, that heating system. Yeah. Mhm. Um, But and now and the next step is I guess getting an electrician out here to. To kind of, uh, see if they can figure out what's going on. Right, um, I will say usually when you get panels, they go according to your bills that you currently have to determine the size of system you would get. Yeah. Yep. And when you add things, it will change your utility bill and the panels may not be able to cover that usage as well. um, but we still need to address, of course, the trigger. Yeah. Right. Yeah. OK, so yeah. I'm, I OK. Yeah, gotta, gotta figure it out because I mean as far as I'm concerned, these things are supposed to be efficient and they, you know, something's not being efficient, you know, not when, not when my bill goes from $*** a month to $**** a month. I gotta figure that out. Right. Oh wow. I don't, I don't know if that's just the panels. Yeah. That's a drastic job. No, I don't, I don't, I don't think it is either. Yeah, it's a big jump. I don't think it is either, but it's just good to get it. Right. Get it all situated so that we can point the finger at whoever it is and say, you gotta come, you gotta come and fix it. Mhm. Right, right. Right. So, yes, we, we certainly do have a case open. So yeah, it's so drastic jump and it's. Uh OK, OK. And it does take time for the system to trigger because it will wait a certain uh it has a threshold that it will allow something to happen and then that triggers the work order because sometimes your production information just doesn't load. OK. Yeah. OK. Like in that day. So we give it about maybe * to ** days before the system triggers anything. So, when it did that, it opens your case. Got you. Got you. Yeah. OK. So it could have just been like when you called, it was around that same time that. OK, do we know, do we? It opened. So it's been about, about *, *.* weeks. OK, do we have a an estimated time? I don't, but you will get a text. You should get a text message to let you know when someone's coming. If your system is not behind a locked gate, you don't have to be home. Of when somebody will come out here. OK. They will do the work. They don't generally need to get inside. So they'll be able to do whatever needs to be done. But I know you said you work from home. So, but they will come and take a look, do whatever they need to do. Sometimes we do use contractors, so they may or may not be in uniform. No OK perfect. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Yep. Nope, that's it. Alright, well I do appreciate your patience with us and we will get on this as soon as we can. OK, thank you. You're welcome have a good day. Bye bye. Bye bye.","Customer reported concerns about solar panel production, citing unexpectedly high electricity bills.

95e2e225-1701-4d6a-9749-acbc2c04eeb1,"Good morning. Thank you for contacting Passenger. My name is Marianna. How can I help you today? Yes ma'am, uh, I just had a service call, uh, come the guy came out and told, told us that the, uh, panel was bad on our, uh, system and, uh, that it'd be a week before they come out to, to change it out, which is fine. I was just calling because they never did address anything other than what they're gonna compensate me on for the last year that my my stuff hasn't worked and all of the. Times I've tried to get somebody out there to come and nobody ever showed up until last week when I said if I don't get somebody out there next week, I'm taking them off my roof and then somebody shows up. Hm OK, can you provide me with your name and your address so I can look into your account, sir? Joshua, J O S H U A, Labot L A B A D. And it's [REDACTED]. OK, give me just one moment, I'm reviewing your account now. It I mean I'm sure you could tell on y'all and that that it hasn't been working in forever. And if you can, I can get a printout of all the bills from energy stating how it hasn't been working. I'm paying you all monthly for the system and still. $** a month or whatever it is $** a month on top of the fact that I got a $*** electric bill, so basically the panels are costing me money these days. OK. I'm gonna go. I'm not saving money. I'm, I'm spending more. *, so I do see that there is. These sources OK So I do see that somebody went out for today, is that correct? Yes. Yeah, OK, mm. Somebody went out today. They came, they got this, they got the panel to actually power on because I went over there when I, when I got home, I looked, I said they got it all still, so they didn't fix it because it said service call was complete on a text message and then I went inside I said hey. Did, did somebody knock on the door for the, for the panels? She and my wife said yes and they said that. They got it they got it taken care of, but they gotta come back in a week and change out the panel. I said, OK, and that's fine, but I mean they didn't call. I'm not gonna give me an update and let me know what's going on. It's just that the service call is complete, so I'm calling myself to find out exactly what the deal is and then I also wanna figure out what they're gonna do about this, like whether they just not gonna charge me for the next however many months. That they haven't been working and. Mm What what's gonna happen here because I'm, I'm not gonna. Something's gotta happen. I've been paying hundreds of extra dollars a month on top of a $** bill that y'all got, but you have these panels. So at this point it's almost crazy for me to even have them. OK, uh, what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm gonna go ahead and uh get in contact uh with um our diagnostic rep so that way they can determine how many months, um, or inform me how many months you haven't been, um, how much your system has not been producing for those past months. Um, and with that I can determine um. How much we can assist with the deferment for your account. Correct, like, I'm not asking for money back. I just want, uh, uh, if, if, if they ain't been working in a year, then I don't wanna pay for the next year because I've already paid and they wasn't working. I lost money. I paid energy $*** a month. You know, and I'm paying y'all $** that's $*** a month, you know, OK, well, hey, this is what we're gonna do once we get you back up and running the next * months or whatever it's been not working we're not gonna charge you that $** and then I'll be happy. I'll be. So I'll be happy about that, you know, but don't tack it on at the end of the note either, saying, oh, you still owe it. You know what I'm saying? Yes, I, I completely understand where you're coming from. um, as I mentioned we could determine it, it would be basically credited to your account so that means that um for the amount of time that your system was not producing or that it wasn't working, then we would provide um that that credit for for your account. Got you, and I'm good with that as long as they can actually do something and not just tell me they come in like they did the last * times and finally I got on the phone and I had to be a little not disrespectful, but I had to kind of say, listen, here's the deal. I've made * appointments. Nobody ever called back or showed up to my house. I'm this is not the *th time I'm calling if somebody does not show up or call me back by next week. I'm taking them off the off my roof and they'll be sitting in my yard for y'all to come pick them up and that's when I got somebody to come out. OK. So give me just one moment, Mr. Lobot. I, I com I completely understand where you're coming from, um, in regards to the system not, not working. Um, I can see how frustrating that can be. So I'm gonna try to reach out right now. I almost thought y'all was out of business, to be honest. I thought y'all was out of business just for a while. I haven't been seeing oxygen trucks nowhere. And I'm like, what the hell's going on? Did I just buy a system and these people go out of business and I'm still being charged? Cause my shit ain't working. No, sir. No, sir. Uh, give me just one more. I was starting to worry that for a minute and then, then when I had a kind of basically, I guess you say threaten them to threaten to take my shit off and, and return them. That's when everything started. I started getting some answers and, and things started moving. I'm like, man, it shouldn't be like this. Yeah, I, yeah, I totally agree with you and I do apologize for that, um, but I'm gonna go ahead and try to see what I can do on my end and see how quick we can get the deferment for your account, OK? OK. OK. And I'll be reaching back out to you um as soon as I get a response to see how how far long or how many months the system was not working so that way we can provide you uh with a credit to your account. I can tell you how long. It's been, it's been at least a year because That's the last time we had a storm event. And I remember going over on the side of the house when I was, uh, when my electrician was there hooking up, hooking up, uh, A breaker for a generator, and he's, and, uh, he said, hey, you know, your panels aren't working on. I said, what do you mean, yeah, it working. He says, no, this system ain't even powered on right now. I said, no shit. Well, that's when it brought my attention and I after the storm had passed through, I gave y'all a call the first time, nobody in. No, I got a call and they said, oh we're scheduling something now. Then I did that * more times and nobody, and I never could get anybody to come up. So if you would make a note of that as well, just because I appreciate you you helping me because obviously you're doing your job, um, but whoever was prior wasn't doing what they were supposed to do. I can tell you that. OK, give me just one. Because I own a business, if I don't reply to my customers, they're going elsewhere or they're gonna start bad mouthing me? OK, so at this time I'm just pending a response, um, from one of our team member, uh, team members so they can provide me, uh, with the amount of, uh, months, uh, that the system was not producing or not working so that we can provide you, um, order a credit to your account. Um, I will be contacting you as soon as she reaches out to me, so within the next day or two days I'll be reaching back out to you. Mhm. OK. OK, um, Mr. Lavitt, is there, you're, you're welcome. Is there anything else that I can assist you with for today? I appreciate it. That's it. OK, well thank you so much for contacting Postagegen and you have a great rest. Go ahead. Can you tell them, can you have someone, can you have someone give me an update on exactly what's going on with the system as well so I can know because uh I like to be in the know of what's going on. Yes sir, I can, I can notate that on the account as well. Just have them call me and let me know something or what what's the next steps other than them coming out to fix the swap the panel out and I'm gonna tell you when I got this system the day they installed it when I got home that evening, you know, they send you text messages, how was your install blah blah blah, all this good stuff. I said everything seems to be fine, but why did y'all put a used panel on my house? Y'all told me it was a new system. Oh well, uh, this was just a this is one we had taken back for nonpayment. It's still brand new. I said it's faded. There's no way this thing's brand new. Well, it was only on a, on a building for a little on on another house for a little while, and we was able to discount this one. Well, obviously the one they put on my house that was discounted come off of a house because it was broke. Mm. You know, and here we are. I'm paying for a used unit when it was supposed to be new from Jump Street. So all this could have been avoided if they just did what they told me in the very beginning and put the brand new brand new panel on from day one. But instead, they sent me a used one with use solar panels because I even questioned it. I said, well, this, everything looks good, but the panels are filthy dirty. I said, and, and the panel inside the house. It's faded. You could tell it's been installed somewhere before. Oh well that was a discounted system and all of that yeah well now I'm dealing with this with a broken unit for the last year or whatever. So if you would, can you tell him to put a brand, a new one on this time and not a used one? Yes sir I can notate it on your account um also are we uh. But That way I'm not going through this all over again in a few months. Yes, sir. I think that would have been the original solution from the jump, but I guess they, they thought otherwise and now they gotta come out and fix it. OK. So I did notate it here on your account, um, Mr. Lovat, is there anything else that I can assist you with for today? Hello That would be it. OK, well thank you so much for your time and you have a great rest of your day and if you have any further questions or concerns uh give us a call back. You too. I will, thank you very much. OK, thank you. You're welcome you have a great day bye bye.","Customer reported a malfunctioning solar panel system for at least a year.

So yes, it looks like they're gonna be out there tomorrow between * and *. That's for a site survey. So that's the very first step what we do is we take pictures of the area that we're gonna work in. And then that helps us uh design um your solar system and once we have that design, we can go ahead and take it to the engineer. Oh OK OK OK. And, and let me ask you, do you have the Posygen app on your cell phone by any chance? Or do you need those? OK, got, got, OK, got what now? The Posseen app is an app. No, I don't. I don't. I can, I can send it to your, to your phone. That's not a problem. Uh, what phone do you have? Do you have an iPhone or an Android? Android. Android? OK, so I'm gonna send you this link. In this link, what it does, um, well, when you download the app, it's going to have a section where you see your billing statement in the future, you can also see your project status, um, and you can go also uh add referrals, which Which Posseen will pay you only through the app for referrals. So, right now the referrals, they're paying $*** per referral. So it's a, it's a great time to do that, OK? But you have to download the app because they only do the payments through the app. OK. OK. OK. OK. Um, uh, do you have any questions for me or? Uh I think I, I was **, my leg, um. They gonna, before they put the uh solar panels on, uh they will be checking the roof, right. Yes, ma'am. So tomorrow when they actually go there on site, they're also gonna look at that roof and make sure that um that it's in a good condition. If not, then they'll they'll document that and then they'll let the office know where um They'll send, they'll they'll see, uh, send you like um a write up of a quote or see what can happen. Uh, it just depends on how bad it is, if it is bad, if it's not, then they'll they'll just, they'll just look at that. Mhm. OK. OK then. OK, that's fine, that's fine. Yes. And you said an Android, correct? Yeah, and I know uh. Yeah, I got an Android. I got an Android. And he was also uh telling me uh that. OK. Uh-huh. I would pay the $** you know, uh, you know, for, you know, the ** days passed and then uh it'll be, you know, the **st payment would be $**. Mhm Mhm. Yeah, and we, we usually, well, I haven't looked at your lease. I, uh, usually when, whenever they turn on the system, like uh whenever you're activated, then you'll get a phone call and I will go through all of it. Actually, even before they, uh, right after, let's just say. Yeah. After the, the, the guy tomorrow, they're gonna give you a call and go over the lease term and everything. So you, you'll know, um, you'll get a final call like it's called final lease lease agreement. OK, OK. OK, and um, but how's your experience so far with our company? Oh, everything's been good, been good so far. It's been good. Wonderful, wonderful. So great. That's good to hear. Just we just like to get um you know, write down the feedback and if there's anything we can do better, just let us know.

OK. Now, is this, is this with, I was gonna ask you, is this with your light bill or is it gonna be two separate bills? It would be two separate. This would be just your, this is just for your panels, um, your utility, it just depends on like, you know, how much, how much your energy, your panels produce and like whatever they don't, like, whatever you use more, that's what your what your utility is gonna bill you. OK, OK, yeah, that's that's what I was wondering. Mhm. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, cause I, so I see, yeah, that's what I was wanting to how, you know, how you can work, you know. Cause uh like I said, the um light bill, it would come out. Mhm. Now, I want to ask you this, OK, the light, OK. The $** is coming off my card, but uh that's a separate bill because see I'm that's what I'm trying to find out is I need to be looking. Mhm. Uh, to two different bills instead of on one bill. Cause see, uh, the, the people in my house, we, uh, Yeah. Slit, we kind of split the bill, so I need, I'm gonna have to need to know. Uh, well, I'm gonna have to see how, you know, to work around. Cause you, we mostly pay the bills on the *rd. Mhm. And I was trying to make sure that that bill come out around about the time the light bill come out. Oh, OK. Um, so, Whenever they, I don't know if they set you up yet, but usually whenever they set you up with the bill, it's usually the *st, the *th, or the **th is the dates that they'll like give you to be drafted. Um, so I'm not sure which date um if they set that up yet, but. OK. I think I picked, I think I picked, I think I picked the **th, but I was thinking I didn't, I was, I didn't know that it was two separate bills, so. OK. Oh, OK, OK. So I, yeah, yeah. See, I was thinking that it's all gonna come on ** bill. Oh, OK, OK. So I need, yeah, I might need to have that to come around when the light bill come cause, well, well, actually, the light bill come out on the **th. I mean it's due on the **th. Oh, OK. It's due on the **th, so that make that y'all been then took y'all part out before I got before I get the idea. OK. OK. Yeah, and, and, and, you know, if ever you want to change it, you can later on, uh, we can send you a link and you can change it um to a different date, and you can change whatever, you know, account to, uh, however you want to do it, but yes, it would be two different bills. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. So Alright. What I'm gonna do is go ahead, I'm gonna text you the link for, for the um for the referral, you know, uh and also for, for our company link, and then I'll go ahead and send you another text with my name and my phone number, OK? OK. All right, ma'am. Well, it was a pleasure speaking with you. Just wanted to make, you know, let you know that I will be following up every * weeks, giving you an update.

Um, would you like for for me to just leave a message for him? We are in the process of selling our house. And we need y'all to email us what the procedure is. For the buyers to transfer the policy? The lease. It's OK. We need to have a communication that says yes it's transferable and this is what the buyer needs to do. OK, um, so as far as the lease transfers, um, the, the process is the customer has to assume the lease, so, um, the information that's requested from the from the buyer would be his, uh, basic information it's like an application that they have to provide to us in order to create an account, um, and then uh we would basically send out a lease assumption to the the buyer, uh so they can sign off on. Um, but there is other options as well. Uh, currently I do see here that there was a temporary uh removal for the panels, is that correct? We are. The first buyer we had didn't want the panels, so we received an email saying what we needed to do in that situation. Now these buyers want the panels to be put back on. And assume our lease, but they want to have something in writing from you all saying that yes the lease is transferable and this is what you need to do. OK. Um, is there? And if there's something we need to fill out we need to know that but. You know it right now the whole closing is hinging on getting this stuff from you guys. And I don't wanna lose the sale because we can't get something. OK. For them to understand. OK. And evidently this is something the bank is requiring. Contract, OK, so in this case then um we do have to have a set up for whenever or schedule uh to have the system reinstalled because I do see here that it's currently uninstalled. Um, so that has to be completed first. Right. But we don't want it. But we don't want it reinstalled for us, we want it reinstalled for the buyers. Co Correct, um, do you have any information regarding the buyer like their email uh name so that way I can go ahead and send over some information to them? No. I can give you my realtor's information and she is contacting them. We're still dealing with realtors we're not dealing with them one on one. Oh, OK, um, if you like, I can send you an email. That's the problem. I can send you an email and provide you with the details of what um what needs to be completed in order to transfer over the lease. Uh, the email address that we have on file is DVsteens**@gmail.com. Is that a good email for you? OK. DD Stevens. D as in Dog. V as in Victor. Stevens **. At gmail.com, yes. OK, um, so I can go ahead and send you an email of what exactly needs to be completed in order for us to transfer over the lease, um, but if the, let's see. Once we send them that then I think they will contact y'all and do what they need to do. But they just need to say yes this is assumable as opposed to us just telling them it's transferable. I've sent them a copy of the lease, but the bank is just being. Difficult OK, uh, so give me just one moment. I'm gonna go ahead and send you an email at this time and I just want to ensure that you, uh, receive it, OK? Give me just one moment, Miss Stevens. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. You are on hold.

f1bbf8ca-7ee5-4cc1-a4a3-4f229fe7be6b,"Hello? Hey Ms. Lester. This is Amy. Can I help you? Hey Annie, this is Lakesha with Positing on a recorded line. How are you today? I'm sorry, where are you calling from, hon? I'm calling from Posogen on a recorded line for quality reasons. Oh, pause it again. I'm sorry, my stupid car. It's, the volume is so low because of the fan. OK, let me see if I can turn down the fan. All right. There we go. All right. I can hear you so much better now. Oh my gosh, my heater's on. OK. How's it going? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. It's going well, thank you for asking. How are you today? Um, I'm good. I'm very glad to hear from you guys because I was starting to wonder, um, what's gonna happen next. Oh, what's, is there something, maybe I'm out of the loop? What, what's happening? So the, the solar panels according to my electric bill are not generating. Mhm. And I called, I don't know like * weeks ago and they said. I can see, yeah. And they said that hey we're gonna get you on schedule and there's there's a whole bunch of other things I haven't been comfortable with this since the whole beginning um so now we've got panels that are if I read between the lines they're not guaranteed to generate. Mhm. Mhm. And then I've been trying to get Someone to come out to fix it. And here we are and because I was told it could take * to * weeks, yeah, I, I was told it could take * to * weeks to even get on the schedule, and I talked to Juan then I film in he said I'll, I'll be reaching out to you. I never heard back from him again, so I called. Right. Still waiting for a date. Yeah. Mhm. God Lord, last Monday, I don't even know what day it is. Um, last Monday or Tuesday, yeah, because I gave him, I gave him an extra day. I was like maybe he's busy Mondays are crazy, um, and so I had another gentleman say he was gonna get back to me by the end of the day and I didn't hear from him, so. Yeah. Last Tuesday, I can see it. Yeah. OK. Here we are. Yeah, I can see that he um reached out to um he reached out to someone in the scheduling department I can see that notation here and they must not have gotten back with him because I don't see any further notation for him um this is what I was gonna do because I do see the communications cases open um. And let me see, did you send, did you send your bills in to anyone here? Electric bills? No, so they told me that, oh no, we don't reimburse you electric bills. The first person told me they did and then the next person says, oh no, no, we just reimburse you the $*** and whatever dollars Dan gets charged, and I said, OK. Mhm. Yeah. And that's fine. I just, I'm, I'm, I'm like at a loss because the bill came through last month and said, hey, it must be generating cause they said to me they won't charge me is what he said. He said they won't charge me till they know that it works. They do this ** day grace period, and I said, Oh well, that's good. And he said, don't worry about the electric bill. I said, are you sure? He said, Yeah, no problem. Well, now Amy has a $*** electric bill that she has to take care of, um. Yeah. Because yeah, because the payment plan got broke and now I'm like, well I feel stupid and he's like, oh no, it'll it'll work it'll work once they get it to connect again it'll work so I'm like I'm still on the hook for this dance. I still have to pay this, so I don't know what to do. Like according to Dan, they were supposed to fix the leak in the room. The leak was never fixed and then when I talked to the contractor, she's like, oh, that was never in the original contract. We cleaned and repaired your chimney for free and I'm going, ma'am, nothing's for free. But however, I digress. I know you can't do anything about that. I just, I'm, it just feels very shady. Yeah. OK. OK. Mhm. Um, and now I've got a system that is on my roof and I'm worried about the integrity of the roof with all this weight on it, and it doesn't work like it doesn't work. It's just, it's just a paper weight on my roof. Mhm. OK. I can, I can address a few things in that. First, I'm not sure who Dan is, so I'm not, I'm, I'm guessing those who, OK, um. Oh, that's my husband. Dan is the guy who signed the paperwork. That's my husband. He's the brilliant one who thought this was a great idea. That's it. Yeah. OK, so, um. Um, go on. As far as um roof leaks or anything, I don't show anything here about a roof leak, but if that's something that you guys address with Power Energy Solutions, who has installed your panels, then I wouldn't see that. So I'm not sure if that's who you addressed that with. So that's That's whoever he, so you guys are like the sub of the sub, right? So the lady who came out to sell this whole Dr. Pepper elixir said, oh, you're gonna pay this and you don't have to pay your electrical anymore, and he did it, a flying sinker. Right. Mhm. And so that's the one who supposedly told him, we're going to fix your roof leak. It's gonna be fine, and we're gonna clean it and we're gonna patch it. It'll be perfectly safe. And um after the installation, all kinds of electrical problems came. They, they Mhm. had to put a down rod in the ground and it blew a fuse in my house to where it burnt my air fryer. I mean, I could go on, honey, for forever, but whatever I can do to either get these things working or undo this madness because one and something's got to give. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. I can tell you as far as us, we do not expect you to pay as long as the solar panels are down. As long as they are not working, we do not expect you to pay at all. So, the who, the person who you spoke with here with us was correct. OK. We cannot give you any help on the electric bill, but we can give you anything that you've paid to us back as a credit. And if maybe you're down longer than what you've paid us, then we would do a deferment. The deferment just puts everything on the back end. But bottom line, we do not expect you to pay while the system is down, which is why I was asking about the electric bills, because what I can see here. OK. OK. OK. It looks like a communications issue, but we can't tell about communications if you're also producing unless we see your electricity bills. So I'm gonna send you over an email requesting to see your electric bills because let me see how long you've been. Right. With this November I think November. So, it hasn't been long at all. And he got billed It's, I think November it got installed or September and it got turned on in November, right? And then March, I think he said the first bill came through from February or March. Mhm. Yeah. OK. Yeah, so, and that's actually the only one that's been paid, it's been the March bill. So any credit that I give would only be for that one month. Any other time that you need would have to be a deferment, OK? Um, and that puts everything on the back end. Yeah. Right. Listen, I, whatever, whatever it is, I really, I really don't, I really don't mind or care because it's not. As long as it's fixed, yeah. It As long as it's fixed, because at the end of the day, I'm, I'm going to take my battle and this is not the hill I will die on, but um I just want it to work and I want it to work soon because, you know. Mhm. OK. It's, it's irritating because I. Yeah, cause the electric bill is crazy. Yeah, so it's either one or the other, and then also I think I'm gonna have to have a roofer come up and I can't have them come up if there's panels up there covering the roof. So I need to know if this is going to stay, then it's gonna stay then I need to get a roofer and coordinate how to get it, you know, how to get them access, but it's not gonna stay because it's not working for whatever reason, then we need to coordinate removal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna send you an email requesting the last * bills. The email address that I have on file is actually Dan. It's the lesser**@gmail.com. Do you have an email address that you'd like me to send this request to? Yeah. You can send it to Dan's. I have access to his email. Um, I, I, because I got the, I got the contract one sent over and I was like Dan did not read this because it's not a rent to own. It's a lease that you have the option at the end of the lease to purchase. He has no idea, so, um, this person told him at the end that he can transfer it to the next owner, blah blah dah dah, and he doesn't own it, so, um, I don't. OK. Yeah. Yeah. To buy, yeah. Yeah. Can I ask you a question? I don't know if you know this. If, if it were to be, if it, if I were to request it to be removed, how much would it cost, uh. Huh. To have it removed. If that had to happen, how much would it cost us? Well, this is the unfortunate part because we want to be able to get it fixed so that everyone is happy because the unfortunate part is with, with our organic customers here, not our partners, you have a *-day window from once you sign the contract in order to cancel. So if you don't get it canceled within Yeah Right. ** days you are technically locked in. Of course there are options or things that may occur before installation that if you wanted to have them um to cancel before actual installation and we could do that. So I assume that will be the case for you guys as well, but once everything is installed, you are pretty much locked in, which means you would have to pay out the contract. For ** years. Yeah. For ** years Not **. I hope it's not ** years. I'm showing that. I swear to God I think it said ** years, so I, so you're saying we're screwed to have a system on our roof that doesn't work. Maybe you were thinking about the amount because I'm showing the total, maybe you're thinking about the contract amount, but it's, I don't, I don't believe it's gonna be ** years, no, ma'am. Um. Maybe. Cause I, I cause I remember reading and I was like, dear Jesus, because I read that you can remove it, but it would be the cost to remove it. Mhm. No, ma'am. So I wanna know how much that is. That's not what it says. All right, I need to read over this again. Jesus Christ. Oh, excuse me, he is such an idiot. Yeah. No, that's, yeah, that's not what it is. So you would still be responsible. For the He's and here's the thing, I'm, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I'm co-owner of this house, but it didn't require me to sign this contract so what disturbs me is that he can make a unilateral decision without the other owner's consent. That's what's really scary because now I'm quasi financially responsible for something that I didn't want, so I just wanna make sure that I'm tracking that is that. It's OK. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, and I'm course picking up my kit, so let me see if I can find this in the email. So you're saying there is no way to have it removed. Uh-huh. Yeah. So the total number of amounts is *** payments. OK. That's the total amount. So divide that by, that's **. That is a long lease. Dude, this is bull. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, hon. I think this is an absolute crock of crap. There's been so much damage to things in my home. It broke my heater. It broke my air conditioner. Yes, the electrician came out, but they didn't replace my air fryer. They didn't replace my kids' electronic stuff that they broke. I mean, I'm sorry, but this is absolute malarkey, and I'm, I'm a really That's a long way. Mhm. Easygoing person, but I don't think I've ever been this miffed um about something so just because you guys are powering what the heck are you guys? You're positivegen right? so. Mhm. We're positing, yeah. Power Energy Solutions is who installed it for you. So I got All right, and that's the contract that I have because it says. Yeah. So. So initial term ** years. No no no no. *.*% each year. Ownership. Must notify us properly about potential warranty claims. Oh God, of course. I'm sorry, hon. Are you customer service? Are you contracts? What, what is your role, dear? No, you're OK. I I'm neither. I'm actually the account manager for payment when everything happens, but at the same time, I do like to make sure that everything is correct. I don't expect my customers to pay if their system is not working. So that's the reason why we want to go over and make sure that, um, everything is as it should be. Well, I appreciate that. And I can't do anything about the contract itself, but I can let you know what the terms are there. So if you decide you want to have them removed, you'd be responsible for the total cost of the lease, minus whatever you've paid. So that would be $**,***.**. That's, I know, right? So that's right there on the lease. OK. Jesus Mary Joseph. Holy jumped up Christ. OK, so you, you may elect to have the system removed and pay us a fee equal to our labor, equipment, overhead permitting marketing, and other associated costs to remove, remarket and redeploy plus any applicable taxes. So that cost of removing. Said paperweight is equal to the lease is what that's saying because I feel like that's not very clear, just so you know. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. So Oh man, this is um. That's, um. You're more than welcome. How many people get roped into this? Like, oh my God, this is bad. I'm sorry, this is bad. This is bad. It No, I understand. I completely understand your concerns. My main thing is making sure we get the system working for you. So that's what I'm gonna work on doing right now for you, OK? So, I'm gonna see. I hope you can. I hope you can because Oh good Jesus. I'm reading this dude. Oh my God. Yeah, see if we can get somebody out there. Yeah, please, because Yeah. I am just End of initial term renewal termination. Well, I'm giving you a ** year ahead, um, notice when it's been on there ** years if I'm still kicking, please get it off the damn roof because um. Yeah. My God, my kid will be right. I'm sorry, I don't think anyone should be able to put a permanent fixture on somebody's house without both parties agreeing. I really just. Yeah. I don't think you should be able to do this early purchase, how much, how much is early purchase? I'm curious. Yes, ma'am. But it's still the, whatever the cost of the lease is, that's it. So, what happens is at the end of your lease, if you wanted to purchase, we would determine whatever the fair market value is of the panels. So, um, if you decided that you want to purchase them, we would have to determine whatever that fair market value is. If it's more than what your lease amount, of course, we would put. Um, that amount of your lease plus the difference, um, if it's less than what your lease amount is, then you may be able to do that. That's what our organic customers, but with our partners with Power Energy Solutions, I'm not sure if it's gonna work the same way. OK, again, so we're subcontracted from this other company um. Yeah. Yes, ma'am. OK, alright, so. Alright, yeah, find out what you can about getting somebody out as soon as possible and then I'll go appeal my frustration. Yes, ma'am. Now, I did email you requesting those last * bills so I can check for any sell back and then any credit or deferment that I can apply to your account, I will, OK? So if you could just whenever you can. OK OK. Well, it's only $*** hon. Don't, don't go crazy. Don't go crazy. It's only $***. Yeah, but either way we wanna get it where it needs to be, you know, so either way, OK. No, I get it. I get it, but I again, it's, it's *** bucks. I'd rather get that sent back to his account for penance for this madness, but I don't think you guys are gonna be able to do that, right? You're not gonna refund him. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. It's either gonna be a credit or a deferment for you. Yes, ma'am. Alright. That's fine, yeah, just credit whatever, whatever you need to do, um, so I'll send. Yes, ma'am. I, I just need to see the bill so I can see that, OK, if you can. OK. Oh yeah, yeah, I'll send the bills because I've been looking at it and he's like oh it just needs to catch up it just needs to catch up and I'm like that doesn't make any logical sense. So um I will, I will send those to you so what do you need for me to move forward with getting people to my house? Yeah. Uh, nothing. I just need to get in contact with our field services team to see who's gonna handle that. If it's someone from our team, if it's someone from, um, Power Energy Solutions, either way, and we need to get it scheduled. That's it. But the same thing that Corey did for you last week, it's just me. I have to reach out to them and then we do have to wait for them to reply to us unfortunately I'm sorry. I Yeah, that's what Juan did too. Yeah, I mean, here's my question to you is how long can I Yeah. For them to agree to it, and I please don't mean, please don't think I'm meaning this meanly. Are they expecting me to wait ** years to have this fixed and scheduled because what Juan basically told me between the lines required to work. Mhm. OK Say that again. So Juan said in so many words, the system's not required to work. So how long? Should we anticipate this to be leading somebody to fix it because you're the *rd person. So I want to say that's untrue, right? So what he maybe was trying to tell you is that what you are paying us for is for the solar panels for the equipment or working equipment. You don't pay us for the production. The production is a plus. That's why you get the panels. That's the whole purpose of it, for to be able to produce energy and you'll be able to save on your electricity bill. But what you are paying us for is the equipment. It needs to be working equipment. If the equipment is not working, we don't expect you to pay for us. We do expect you to give us time to get it fixed in order to give us time to make it right. That is what we do expect. OK. But we don't expect you to pay for equipment that is not working. So I'm not sure if that was the right way for him to explain that to you. OK? OK. I think we were going through the minutia of the contract because Dan said that they guaranteed it to work or they wouldn't charge me and that it's guaranteed to generate and he's like, well, not really. I was like so so I I guess technically you're both saying the same thing but um. Mhm. No. Mhm. At the end of the day, it is what it is, but you know, I thank you for listening. Um, so, but I'm not crazy. That is a long contract. I saw I could do math, you know, it's very long and it's not, and it's honestly, it's not financially beneficial for us at all because our electric bills aren't always $***. So I don't know whoever did the math. That's not right. Yeah, no, I completely understand. It it's very long. It's very long. It's very long. Yeah. Um, I know because I pay the electric bills. I'm the one who pays the bills. So, um, I really hope that, see, here's the other question too, is that what if Dan doesn't pay this bill? Yeah. You know, what if this bill doesn't get paid this whatever $***? What happens then? Mhm. Does it go into collections? Do you take it? Like, how does this work? Because he didn't explain that to me. He's like, it's not gonna happen. Yeah, at a, at a certain point we do. At a certain point we do take it. It does go into the collections, um. OK. But we, our collections is in-house though, so. OK. I got you. At a certain point, it does. I just wanted to know Yeah. Because he thinks he's buying it, just so you know, he. He's like, oh, I'm renting to own it. That's what she said. You're gonna own it at the end. I'm like, no, she saw you coming. No, the the, the girl saw him coming. She is a slimy businesswoman. I, I, and I, and I believe that cause I think that unless he heard what he wanted to hear, and let me, let me give her the credit for that. Maybe he heard what he wanted to hear, but I heard, I heard they were fixing the leaking roof because how can he put something on a roof that leaks. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Yeah. Do you guys put things on roofs that leaks? So No, so you're saying the roof was leaking before the panels were installed? Exactly, and I said, Dan, we can't put things on a roof. There's a leak in front of the chimney. Oh, And he said they're going to fix it, Ames. They're going to clean the roof and they're going to patch it. And I said, Oh, OK. So there was a dude on my roof when I came back from a business trip in September. He didn't answer me when I spoke to him and I was like, Oh well this is just cute. So when they were installed, the inspectors came out after the debacle with the electricity. They turned it on. This was I guess October, November, right? And Mhm. We got a nice big rainfall and the roof was leaking and I said, Oh well, I thought it was fixed. He's like, oh, I'll reach out to her. He never reached out to her. And I finally got her number from Home Power Home Energy Solutions, and she texted me and she said that it well it wasn't part of the. Mhm. We did that for free. We cleaned your roof and patched your chimney for free, and I'm going so you can put it in with a leak. So I'm asking you, do you have any documentation that proves that my roof was safe for installation? No, ma'am, and we wouldn't have that in that proof, um, that will be something that Power Energy Solutions would have, we wouldn't have that. So the other the other company, OK, that's what I'm trying to understand is that. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Would you think that they could put something on a roof that doesn't Have, you know, I don't know. Anyway, what, um, I, I don't think I, I, I wouldn't, I would never suggest putting pen on a roof that was already, um, structurally unsafe or already damaged. You know, I, I don't know. That's what I thought, but I don't know, I'm just a therapist. I don't, I don't fix roof, um, so what do I know? But he's like, no, no, no, you put it on the, the rafter thing. I don't forget the word he used. But, um, I'm like, yeah, but it's still wood and wood still can rot if there's a leak on it. The roof is from God knows how long ago, um, and they're like, oh, they're gonna get a grant, they're gonna fix our roof because something was New Jersey and they're gonna do this, and I'm like, whatever. Well, I wouldn't. Yeah. Yeah. So I just, I will send you, you see, you said you need * months of elected bills. Mhm. * months, um, so this month March February, or do you need from October? Um, let, let's go from. Let's do your first payment was March, so let's do um. Let's do February, um, January, February, March. Let's see about there, OK? Let's go there.

This is people who are just unscrupulous and they prey on the fact that people just don't know better and it's sad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, um, what I'm gonna do now is again reach out to that field services team, see if we can get a date for when someone is gonna come out, um, and whenever you get me those bills, I'll take a look at them to see if we need to do a deferment or anything on your account and then we'll check work on a date and again I do not expect you to pay until we get your system fixed now there is paperwork with any deferment. Not necessarily the credit because it's a low credit but with the deferment there is paperwork that I would have to send you, OK? um but the main thing is we wanna get the system fixed that's the main thing, OK? Yeah, I mean, deferment that makes no never mind to me. You can let Dan deal with that because it is what it is, but I'll send you the paperwork to make your life easier. I just don't know what he wants to do, but I'm gonna look into the to the roof thing because that concerns me. Mhm. Mhm. OK. Yes ma'am.

Because with all of our other partners, we do service the panels in from everything we service it all so I will see if that's something that we do as well for you guys, OK? OK. OK.

So would that have anything to do with what I still owe them, or they'll, they'll still figure that out the same way. Correct, so they would, yeah, they will, they was, I don't think you will owe them, um, that's something that they will send you a letter letting you know, um, the breakdown and they'll figure that out with the way, uh, because remember anything that your solar system is overproducing, they, you know, it sells back to them. So they will work that out with you if you owe anything at that point. OK. OK, OK, so at this point then right now I just, um, I just I don't have to worry about anything. I just, we're good to go. That's correct. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link which is for you to register for our mobile app and that mobile app you're able to see any billing statement or if you want to change your billing method, um, and also, um, you can submit referrals through there. Uh, right now we're running a promotion that it's if you refer somebody just for them setting the appointment with us, we give you $*** and then $** and if they do go solar, then we'll give you an extra $*** as well.

I can hear you but take you off. Uh, yes, I was calling about, um, I wanted to speak to someone about my solar uh panels, the expense of, uh. I need I think I need someone to come check it out to make sure it's working properly. Alright, let me pull the production here or account because what's your name or do you have your account number? Uh, I don't have the account number on me. My name is Sue Cage, but it should be in the death row cage. What's the address, please? It's [REDACTED]. OK. Can you repeat the zip code one more time, please? ***** All right. Thank you for that confirmation, ma'am. This call is being recorded. All right. You said West Grove, right? Yes, it's one word. W E S T G R O V E. Oh, OK. All right, I got the information here pulled up. So you have questions in regards of your system? Yes, I've called sometime I've, I've called a while ago to, uh, and I thought they were gonna have someone to come out and check it. Because, um, it, it's gonna go wow. I've never heard anything else. OK, let me see. So, most of the times, uh, ma'am, even If you know you have concerns about that the system is not working properly, the thing with um these systems are that we have the um the option to monitor them um remotely and it's not necessarily most of the time to send somebody out we are able to determine if something is going on with the system without sending somebody out. Plus we have a department that do that. Well, yeah, I. Right, the, the first time that I called, she checked the system and they said nothing was improper, and then my bill, uh, because I, I've talked to neighbors and their bills are, you know, the uh people that have, uh, pathogen, and I can't understand why my bill is still like over $*** a month. So, you know, I And that was in the summer time when I called. And I understand, you know, that we, because we talk to our neighbors to see how everything is going, but I always tell the customers that we cannot compare because what we have inside of our home is not the same thing, and what we do inside of our home is totally different. Your appliances is different than your um neighbors have. So right now I I pulled up the production of your system and your system is working perfectly fine. Like. Yes. Yes, yes. There's no alerts showing for March. Your system produced *** kilowatts. It has been overproducing for the past few months. So my question would be then what are you doing in your home that you know, that you've seen an increase of the bills lately? For how much is your, um, how much, how much was your last bill? Um, wait, I don't, I, I'll have to check it online to see exactly what it was, but I think it, I think my light bill was actually over. $***. Um, I don't get a bill, just give me one second here. Mhm. Let me pull that up, pull up my energy bill. Bye. And you know. Mhm. I want to No, that's not what I want. No worries. Take your time. OK, one second I'm trying to. Are you serious? Usually I can go straight in, but now it's telling me, OK, let me see. So if you have the app on your phone, go, I think it's gonna be next to um pay your bills, something like that. I don't quite remember, but it's gonna say PDF. So I can't do it. No No, I have it. I have it. I'm, I'm looking on my laptop right now. Oh, OK, OK. Um, I thought I had to enter something else but I didn't. It's OK. Yeah this is. Notification dashboard. Um, Let me see. Billing and statements again. And it's telling me that my bill for. I'm trying to get actually into my. Account Not account but I'm trying to see usage. No I'm in my bills and pay account history. OK, let's see. Oh. I don't know what I could possibly be doing that is so different than I've, uh, except for I know the weather was, I, I can't remember what month that was, but I know the weather uh the snow and things like that, but it actually was, um, It it actually was, was higher. Uh-huh, I'm the same. Um, Before then, it was high. And I just kept forgetting to call, and they did ask me that I want to change to another, um, I guess they were giving out new. What units or something, something they were doing different and the price would be like $** a month. But what was told to me that it would start my Yeah. I'm sorry? No, yeah, I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm sorry. Yeah, That it would change my my amount to $** a month and then it would start all over like the contract would start all over again. And that is what I, I didn't, um, I didn't want. OK, let me see. So that's uh that's an upgraded system. So yeah, it will be a new lease with a a more updated um system, but it will be with um sales if you are interested in doing that. And yeah, your lease is gonna increase. Um, Yeah, it's going to, well, we have how many years? ** years on the lease or something? Let me see. Whatever it was, it was gonna start over and that's what I didn't want to do. Yes. And that OK now I'm looking at. I'm looking at uh shoot. OK, current reading **. It showed **:** p.m. the reading was. The ** So look, on, on, on this, on the second page of your electric bill, you can see the breakdowns that says company KWH to customer and that's what you um bought from Egy. ***. That's what I'm looking. And then below that it says customer KWH to company and that's why you didn't use from the uh production of the solar system, and you sold that back to Entergy. Mhm. Mm So, if you didn't have OK. Solar, the energy would have charged you for the company, the kilowatts that you use. They would have to charge you for the. OK, I'm, I'm looking. Mhm. OK, I'm looking at what you said at the bottom of the bill it said well it says um. Company KWH to customer. Yeah, that's what you And then it says carry over. OK, that said ******. That's the company and then it said customer was minus ***. And then at the bottom of that, it says carry over KWH from last month was *. And carry over. It's just that it's *. So I'm, I'm not understanding exactly when it says company. Is that you guys? No, Egy. Oh, is that energy? That's energy. That's, that's the energy that you are buying from them. That's what I bought from them. OK, so net KWH was ****, it said. So, what are you guys paying for? I mean, what, what? Where it says customer KWH company, that's what the solar panels produce and you sold back to energy. If it's a negative. Man, it It's, it should, it says something, probably you're reading where it says previous meter reading, that's probably what's gonna show in negative. Well, they all showed was I'm looking at the um meter reading contract and the meter number and then it says rate N E RSA and it said total days is like ** and then current uh meter reading **** previous was ****. So I guess. Mhm. Then it says again, The readings and the contract and the card reading for *. I guess April *, April *rd, ****** and previous was **,***. That was for March. But I'm still trying to, I mean you think that the, the, this is what we're using, right? Mhm. Yes. This is, this is the electricity that we're using. And it's showing you. Mhm. That is correct. So what I'm trying to understand if we're using that much and then you're producing or, or we're pulling uh something from your company is. I'm trying to understand how it works, but I know it's, it would be cheaper. Let me see. Uh, Fuel, OK, fuel purchase **. OK. It said ele at the bottom it says in blue it says electric charges. It says energy charge $**.**. Then it says formula rate plan. And it has some percentages there, and then it says $**.**. And it says base rate adjustment rider minus *.*.**. Then it says purchase power cost recovery minus $**.**. And then it says fuel purchase power cost. Da da da and $**.** and then it says energy efficiency, EECR writer $*.**. So what is all this, all of this is saying what? I mean, I'm not understanding it. Hello. Oh, I was on mute. Can you hear me? I'm sorry, I was talking. Can you hear me? Hello. Yes, I hear you now. I didn't hear you at first. All right. So I, I'm, I'm sorry about that. So yeah, I was saying that you mentioned where it says energy charges, that's what you, that's your actual um electric bill. That's how much you um But from Entergy, what increase the electric bills every month, it's all the fees that Entergy is charging you for. So if you would like to know what are the adjustments that they, um, that he, that is on that bill, you need to contact them cause I'm not really sure. But fuel charges, those are the fees that they that they um charge the customer in order to provide electricity. Most of the time we don't control none of that is just energy. But your bill for that month was ** $** that you said. So, But ****. Yeah, that's your actual um bill. But what, what happened is that all the fees that electric company are charging, it may seem that it's more. So for better understanding, I will advise you to contact them and see what they said. What is that adjustment that it's on the bill. * charge. OK, adjustment and this is like, oh, OK, **** at, OK, it says **** at minus *.***% and then it says minus it's, it's uh ** cents. So that's the adjustment. I don't, it's only ** cents. Then it said purchase power costs. **. OK, I'll call MG then because it's showing that my electric bill is really low. It's $**. The electric charge is $** but when they add all the other, it brings it up to $*** a month. Let me see, and then there's an. Mhm. Exactly. Then there's some other charges. So look at um next to to the breakdowns, um, there's a section that says terms and conditions and definitions. I'm sorry, I don't know if you can see it. So it says fuel adjustment. It says cost of fuel needed to generate electricity and the cost of power purchased from other companies. And all this is related to. Yeah. I said Then it says um storm restoration benefits associated with the financing of storm. So yeah, those are fees that Ey are charging you. It's not us. So it's yeah, that's what they told me last time, yeah, OK. OK, uh, I just have to call them and talk to them about all these different choices I got. OK, alright, thank you, thank you. No, you're welcome. You're welcome. I will notate the information here on your account and yeah, everything is working perfectly, OK? OK. OK, thank you. Bye-bye. You're welcome, ma'am.

Yeah, I'm just reading through the notes here. So, so they're uh they're doing an upgrade. The original removal wasn't done. OK, well they can't upgrade until they take the other one off, OK. Um, That's I'm just trying to, I, I'm just reading through the notes on, on, on the, uh, on different cases here, so give me just a minute. So. OK go ahead. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, there was a, uh, it seemed like they, I, I guess they sent out, uh. a notice on the *rd. about disconnection and They canceled it, so I don't know. ******. So I'm just trying trying to, to, to follow the uh the train of thought here so give me, yeah, cause uh yeah. Oh please Please, please. But they're sending this message constantly and I just, I just wanna know what's going on. Yeah, um. I got this message. The message was text today at **:**. Uh. All right. Constant text messages tell me about the bill. Yes ma'am, yes ma'am. OK. Yeah I may have to, I may have to send you over to her. Our our our our billing department because I'm not seeing them why they're. I, I, I see, uh, uh, you know, an upgrade case for you, but I'm not sure why they're still texting you about the other one. It does show that there's still a balance due on it. It Oh, OK, let me just explain the balance of thing. It was only by word of mouth, and I'm so sorry I didn't get it in writing. Yes, ma'am. OK, all I, all I owe was *** and something dollars, OK? Mhm. My previous channel. Mhm. Which is my fault. I should have not changed it, but just talking about being an upgrade to be better panels da da da. I did it. Mhm. Yes. But before I change this over. Uh-huh. That man called, the salesperson called about * different people to see about this balance. He said, you don't have to pay that because the contract was between Adam and them, and Adam no longer exists. Mhm. So therefore that I didn't have to pay it. That's what they say. Uh, they said I have to pay it. I never would proceeded with this process of getting the new panels and extending me for ** more years. I had * more months to pay or * more funds to pay, which I should in my mind I should not have. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Change that should definitely long we just paid it out. So far, they have taken these panels that they want me to pay for. Well, I could pay for those panels if they want this balance just to bring me back the panels. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Cause they was on their minds. Uh, no, ma'am, they, they. That's, that's we can start with this. Yeah, um, the, the, the, there were a lease before and just when the lease is over, yeah, yeah. They, they, they want, what happens when the lease is over? Yeah. Well, you have an option, yeah, no, no, we have a couple of options you can either renew the lease, you can upgrade the system, um, or you can um just turn them in. They become yours? No. When we got, we got this, when we got these panels, wait a minute, let me, let me go back. I have several people that bought the panels the same time we did that we were, you know, when we got ours, they, they also verify. I told them I remember and be purchasing that panels. They say the same thing we purchased them because the state paid up so much money and we had to order **,*** left. It was not a lease. It was gonna be paid up in those ** years. That's my understanding of it. That's the understanding of it. I wish I could find paperwork on it, but I can't. Or you could purchase them. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Anyway, nobody offered me to do a new lease or nothing like that. My $*** have been paid for and I've been done, and I'm so sorry because they paid this and they're done. And nobody asking for no more money, no nothing for no lease or we lose it or whatever it's done. So now I'm sitting in this situation. I got these other panels sitting on my house and they're still asking me money for panels that they took away from me. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. I, I don't, I don't get it. Before we did this decision, I, like I said, they said I didn't need to pay it. I know if I have to pay it, I would not have done going forward with what I've done with. Now I'm just trying to get this thing thing. They come not gonna turn this off. So what they turn off my new panels or what? I don't wanna follow. I, I don't understand. Well Mhm. I, I, I Yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the disconnection is actually for the old system, which doesn't make any sense since they've already, you're already going down to an end, yeah. Exactly. They don't, they're not here. Yeah, and that's that I, I think that's uh so um I'm gonna reach out to the uh to the billing team uh and and get them to, to try and figure this out and, and, and reach out to you uh with an explanation because I, I can't quite figure it out myself as to why, as to why they. Exactly. OK, let me, right, and OK, let me say all that. I'm gonna say all this about * weeks ago they sent a man to the house. So, Mhm. Mhm. I'm telling him about disconnecting the stuff then, OK? And I explained him the same situation. So he didn't touch me, he tried to call somebody because he didn't get in touch with nobody. So he said, go get back with me and after you figure it out, well. Mhm. He has to I've been calling his number and it's been miss never answered and the mailbox is full. So therefore this time I said let me just get back with this and talking about disconnect the game. Mhm. Mhm. What are they doing? They're gonna cut, so he wouldn't they came to the house, I would say OK they weren't gonna disconnect. So he came to the house. So that, that makes me think, OK, you come to disconnect my unit. Yes ma'am. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I No, I just feel like I'm in a hard rocket, a place that, you know, where, where do I go with this. Uh Yeah, I understand. I do understand what you're saying. Yeah, so, um, let me, let, let me, like I said, I got. Yeah, I Yes, and I'm, I'm just, so I blame myself for. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I said, Yeah, I'm the same I know you said you said you just. Go ahead. Mhm. Well, the thing is is that it, that uh it seems that the uh original one that, that we're talking about was uh was uh was for Adam and this and the renewal is actually the, the, the upgrade is going is going into your name I would assume, right? Um and so, um. it, it did. Yeah, um, so what I guess, uh, are, are, uh, Our, our billing team needs to understand is that the, the one for Adam. Is over with and this one is replacing it so um and the and whatever that balance was somebody told you that it's not, it's not due and I I've got to get them to figure out what's gotta be done there um because you know this. Right, but Well, yeah, but see they told the guy that was the sales person that came, he called * or * different people what to do in this situation, and they said I should not be responsible for that because of the contract was between Adam and Posit. So I'm not being I should be responsible for that, but evidently somebody along the line up here said I should be responsible for it. I don't know. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it too that I don't keep getting these messages and and people coming to the house to turn it off and all this kind of stuff. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. Mhm. Yes ma'am, I understand. I don't know exactly how you turn it off, how you turn. Can I ask you a question though? How did they do, how do they do disconnected? By, by the computer or they come to the house and disconnect? Well, sure. It depends on the type of system you have um as to how that how that's actually done. Some systems do require that they come out and physically turn it off. Most of them are, you can do it over the internet to the uh the communication that we have with it over the cell modem. Oh well, OK, well if he came out forever then I must be having these older system that he has to come out and disconnect, which I thought I would get a more of an upgrade system than that. Well, the one that you're the one that you're purchasing is an upgraded system and I don't know that that one, that one would be remote. Um, the original system that was on there, uh, I'm understanding that that one's already been taken off. Is that correct? Yes, yes, take us all the way. We have. OK, that's that's what I thought so they can't, they can't disconnect, they can't disconnect that system, the new system, because the old system is not there. The old system is the one that they're quote unquote disconnecting, but it's already been removed. So, um, and I guess that's what they need to our our billing system is not, is not getting it right, so. No, it's not. Yeah, but this, it's some kind of way that Right, the go ahead, the. Right, right. Somebody's not getting it right. Yes, ma'am. So OK, now what's your name again? You said you don't call me back and let me know um. I'm gonna have somebody from the billing team reach out to you and, and figure this out because I'm actually, I'm actually part of the installation team and you got routed to us because of the, the new system that they're installing, um, our team handles handles handles that side of it. We would update you if there's any delays or something like that. So I need to OK, OK. Oh, Mhm. Um, I'm part of that team, so I don't usually handle this stuff, but I, I did work in the customer care department beforehand, so I understand how it works. Um, but I've just got to reach out to them and let them, uh, try and figure out what's going on here. Um, and so, uh, I, I'll, I'll, I'll send them a message, uh, that the, the system, the, the, the old system has already been removed and a new system is being, an upgraded system is being installed. And that you were, you were told originally. It's already, it's already installed. Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am. Uh. Excuse me, it's already, it's already installed. Yes ma'am, I understand that. I, I, I understand that. Um, I, I guess our, our, our, our, our, our, our, uh our collections billing department, they don't know that they're not, they're not seeing, they see the old system because it's, it's the one that's active, they don't see the new one because it's not, not finished, we haven't finished the installation process to activate it yet, so they can't see that yet. Um, and that's what the, that's probably where the that's where the problem is with them. They see the one that was uh. OK. Wait. It's The older one, so. OK, another question. You say I'm not activated yet? No, I don't think so. Uh, let me double check. We're still waiting on the Let's see, I believe we still are waiting for. Uh, your inspections have passed. We're waiting on the utility company to give us approval, I believe, is what we're on, is where we're at with yours. Oh Yes ma'am, so give me just a second. I'll double check that and make sure, yeah, that's what, that's that's what we're going. It's uh oh it's waiting on Egy to basically uh finish up, um, so. Really You know that that's where it's at. Now do you have to come. So you have to come out? Um, probably, probably not since you had a solar panel system there before. They probably don't have to come out physically to the house. Um, it's just a matter of, uh, updating their, their records with the new system from the old system, um, and then setting it up in their, in their. OK, so you can OK, another question. When you get that pass sticker that don't mean instead of unit zone because the unit is um activated. No, that just means that it's passed it's it's. Even though they turned it on. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's in standby mode right now. Um, so we can do it that's one. Oh, even though it show on, even though it shows on in the media, they're still on standby. Yeah, it's a. Yeah, it's on standby until they give us permission to activate it, it'll sit there and and and it'll show that the system is on. Thank you. But it's not producing yet until uh Ey tells us we can turn it on. Well, sorry, I'm making so glad for telling me that because the man that came out to turn it off, he told me my system was on it was, it was already working. Oh. Mhm. Yeah, he can see that he, he can see that, well, he doesn't, he's not, he's not in it on the installation side. He can look at them and tell it's, it's on, it is physically on, it's, but it's not producing, so, um, so that's where, that's where you're at so. And it's not Right. Right. Right. Right. That So, uh, what I'll do is I'll get the, uh, like I have said, I'll get the, uh, the, uh. Well? For the old system, the, the, I, I'll get in touch with the, the billing, uh, department here and see if we can get them to to straighten this out for you and then reach out to you and and and then we'll see if we can get us the text message to stop, OK? Uh, because they can't disconnect the system that's not there. Please. Yeah. What? Are you, are you? So. Exactly, but then the main character I said when it came out, it, it was kind of like make me OK. But since he came out, I said, what do you do you're going, you know. But I thank you so much for your information because you cleared up some questions that um. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. That would not answer was wrong information, let's put it that way. Yeah, and it He told me I was already connected. Yeah, uh, well, I guess it's a, it's a, it's a, a misunderstanding more than anything, um, you know, uh, the, the team, uh, the guy that comes out there is from the billing team. He's used to dealing with systems that are already installed and, and, and physically out there. He can look at them and tell if they're on or not and functioning, you know, but uh. That's what he did. He showed me that I look at the button. Yeah, yep, it is on, it is on, but it's not, it's not functioning. Um, it's, it's what it's, it's like I said, it's what we call a standby mode. Um, it's, it'll show that it's on, but it's not producing anything, uh, you know, because we can't, we can't do that until, you know, the utility company says we, we have permission, you know, um, and that's, that's, that, that's what we're waiting on for to activate that for you. Uh, we'll get that uh here probably pretty soon. Oh Um, from Entergy, it's just, uh, Entergy and is, uh, has been notoriously slow, to be honest with you, it's uh we're just waiting on them, um, but once we got that permission from them, um, they'll they'll activate it and we'll give you a call uh once it is activated, go over the entire thing with you and let you know how the system works and and all that stuff, OK? Mm Mm Alright, I thank you, I appreciate that. All right. Not a problem, not a problem. All right, any other things I can do for you? No, you answered all the questions I need to ask except one. I don't know if you'll be able to answer it. What happens if you, uh, what happens if you was to sell a house and whatever your units lease? What do you do? Uh Ask away I. Oh, well, that's real simple. Um, the, the lease can transfer to the new owners, um, if in say * years from now, * years or whenever you, you do, if you decide to sell the home, um, you, you would tell the people you disclose it as part of the listing that there is a lease for the system, um, and the new owners can assume the lease at the same point for the same price that you've got it at. Um, you know, and they just basically you've got a ** year lease on, on the system. Um, and they would pick up from whatever point that is, uh, at the same price. So all we would do is we would, we would redo the contracts for them, have them sign new contracts, but they would essentially take over right where you live, leave it off at, um, doesn't cost you anything, doesn't cost them anything. Mhm. OK. So now if for some reason they don't want it, then, then, then there's a little then there might be a problem, you know, then we have to figure out uh uh if they, if they don't want it, uh, the removal of the system and all that stuff, but usually speaking, most people want them. OK. You know, you know, particularly if it's an upgraded system like you're getting right now, um, so, OK. Right, right. OK. Well, thank you. You are quite welcome there. You've been very helpful. Well, I appreciate, I appreciate you say that. Uh, if you have any other questions, uh, please just give us a call, OK? OK, thank you. Thank you. You have a good afternoon. Bye. Bye bye. You too.

916fa03c-5bb5-4cf4-9ef3-d05daea22e72,"Hello this is Randy speaking. Hi, good afternoon, sir. This is Mary calling from Posage and Solar. I Yes, yes, so you left a few voicemail you left a few voicemails for both the, the new buyers and um and their agent and they haven't responded back, is that right? OK, um, I just spoke to the agent, so we're closing May *nd on that house. They, they haven't taken over yet, but, but everything is worked out. We've already. Mr. Randy. Correct. Yes, yes, sir. OK. OK. You know, did everything they did inspections, the whole shebang, so it is happening. Can you do me a favor? I did reach out to his agent. I did speak to him and I told him that, hey, I just got a voicemail and he haven't responded back and so forth and so on. But is there any way, um, you can email me the form or forms that that they need to be signed? They may sign. OK. Um Mhm. Before May *nd, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna be at the closing and I'm gonna give them to the title company as well. So they're not gonna be able to close on the house until they sign these forms, and I want to have them in my possession that way. I, I make sure that they get it signed, not that they're trying, not that they're trying not to sign it, but this is one of those things I can see slipping through the cracks unless I, unless I stay on top of it. So I'm really glad you called, um, can you? Mhm. Yeah. Right, I understand. So unfortunately I cannot send you a copy of the lease assumption, but you can request them from the buyers if they are willing to forward that email over to you, but unfortunately we're not able to send that to you. It would have to be the buyers. That's OK. You, you, you mean from my, uh, from my sellers, you mean can my sellers, the owners of the house now? OK. Yes, so, so no, so the buyers of the home now we sent them the lease assumption so that they can go ahead and assume the solar panels, right, and have the lease transferred into their name. So we went ahead and sent them the documents we did the application, so we've spoken to the buyers already, but now we need a signature and they haven't signed the lease assumption to have it, you know, transferred into their name. I see. Mhm. I see. Um. And so you can't, you can't send me a copy of that, huh? Um, let me ask you this. I'm representing the sellers who currently own the house. They gotta sign that as well. I would, I would think, right? Right. Mhm. So they do not they remain respons since they already have a lease assumption and the account with us, um, currently open. They're still responsible for the account and the payments until that buyer, you know, signs over and y'all close. So even if you don't you do you guys do close on the *nd of May, if they still have not signed, your seller will still be responsible for the payments in the agreement. Oh no. OK. Got you, got you, got you. OK, so they don't have to sign anything. The seller, the current owners don't have to sign anything in relation to the account. Right. Right, they do not have to sign anything we're just uh we're just transferring their current agreements to the buyers. Got you, got you. OK, alright, I'm just gonna to put on my calendar then, um, to make sure because I was gonna make sure I got. Yes, sir, because they will still be responsible for that agreement and the payments until they sign. I got you. Let me ask you, just out of curiosity. Like, what's the, like, why can't you send it to me to make so I mean I'm, I'm the one who's gonna make sure it gets signed, not that they would, they may sign it before then, but they're not gonna go buy the house until they sign it, and I'm gonna be the one to make sure that. So like what I look like is our confidence. Yeah, so that's just policy. It's sent through DocuSign so we have to send it to the buyers for them to sign electronically. So there is no copy yet until they finish signing then we'll have a copy of it, um, and then at that point we'll go ahead and send the buyers a copy of that lease assumption and if they want to send it to you then that's fine, but unfortunately we can't go ahead and send you the lease assumption when it's for them to sign. Got you. Yeah, we know, I got you I got you, um. Right Um, just thinking out loud, um, what I mean, I'm trying to make sure because not that the buyers are trying to get out and not signing it, but if I got, if I'm able to hold over, hey, hey, you can't buy this house until you do sign it, then we know for sure that they they're gonna sign it. But so they're not gonna if if if they are trying to not sign it, they're not gonna give, you know what I mean, they're not gonna give me anything. So, um, but I'm just trying to figure out, yes, I use DocuSign too, but so I mean it's just a document that you upload a PDF you upload the DocuSign. Mhm. Right. Right. Like, why wouldn't y'all be able to give me a copy of that? Like, like, I don't, that's like there's so confidentiality like, like what's the, what's the Right, and like I stated, unfortunately that's just our policy we cannot grant you a copy. Hm. OK Yeah, but I was just calling to see if you have heard from them or if you can tell them to go ahead and check their email um but otherwise and that's all that we would need just their signature. Uh What did you, how, how long ago did y'all send those, uh, how long ago did y'all send the, uh, the DocuSign to them? We sent it last month on the twenty-eighth. OK, and y'all, is there any way you can maybe do that remind you know you can hit remind and I'll send it again like today. Can you do that because I'm, I'm, I'm gonna call. Yep, and we have also spoken to them and they said that they'll go ahead and check their email but still nothing so I did go ahead and resend it to them so that it'll be at the top of their inbox but we still have not heard back. OK, perfect. OK, yeah, so, so you when when did you resend it again today or? Yes, sir. OK, alright, perfect. Well, let me call the agent and let him know that, and uh I appreciate you calling. Stay in touch with me if you don't mind. Call me because I'm gonna be the one that's gonna make sure it happens. So, so, and if you don't mind, if you, when you do get it, so I quit hounding them, if you could please reach out to me, hey, Randy, we got it in that way, um. Yeah, no problem. OK, no problem. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, yeah, um, let me ask you this, and I guess so even after they after they signed it, we still can't get it, we still can't get an executed copy of it saying that it, it that that it's signed, right? I still have to get that from them. I can't get that from you. All right. No, so there will be an executed copy and then if they can provide that to you then that's fine, but unfortunately we can't go ahead and send it to somebody else. It would be for them to send it over to you. Got you. And the seller and, and the current owner doesn't have to sign anything and they can't get a copy of it at all. Cause, cause what it seems weird that, that, that y'all would let the let the, the new people assume everything, you know what I mean? Like, what if the what if the current people Didn't want to let them assume it. You seem to do you need authorization from them, no. From who? From the current, from the, from the current owners of the house. Well, we already did because he initially started this process saying that he was gonna sell his home and that he needed to transfer to the new buyers, so he already gave us authorization to start the lease transfer so they don't need to sign anything. They already have an agreement with us. They just want it transferred to the new buyers. I got you. So y'all just take Right, right, she'll just take that thing verbally, OK. Alright, I appreciate the info. Yeah, please let me know once they sign out. Thank you. I No problem you have a great day. Hey, wait, let me one last question for you. What if, if the sellers wanna make sure that, hey, we wanna make sure that they, that they sign, are the sellers able to get a copy of that or no, nobody can get a copy of it except for the, for the, for the buyers. If they can call to say that they do want a copy of the lease assumption, then yes we can. OK, just, you know, because they're gonna feel better knowing they got something to write saying, hey, you know, knowing that it's officially done. I don't necessarily need it. I'm just trying to make sure it happens. Alright, thanks again, Rosemary. I appreciate it. Alright, alright, bye bye. Right. Yeah.

I, um, I'm a current customer and I have two accounts because there are like * solar leases on my roof, um, which I, I recently took over after purchasing, um, a house, and I'm, I'm looking at the billing, um. Mhm. Mhm. Or the the the bills for the for this month and for last month and um I wanted to make sure I understood the amount like the monthly amount due for each lease correctly. I I was wondering if you could help me with that. Mhm. OK. OK, that, no problem. And who am I speaking with? Uh, my name's Francis Fleischer. OK, and Mr. Fleischer, what's the address listed on your account? [REDACTED]. OK. Awesome. Um, zip code is *****. OK. Thank you so much for verifying that information for me, Mr. Fleischer. Um, and so your main concern is that you just took over this lease. You're looking at the bills and you just want to clarify how much each account is, correct? Yes. Awesome. OK. So I've got the first one pulled up here for you and if you'd like to write down this account number, it's the ***. ***-***. OK, I have that up right now too on the payment uh page. OK. Awesome. And so that. So I have it set up with autopay. Uh, you do, I do see that there. And so normally it looks like previously you were paying $**.** a month, but I wanna check to see if there's an escalator because I do see that coming in May it's gonna be $**.** so I just wanna look at the um service contract if that's OK. Just give me one second. Mhm. Oh yeah sure thing. And that is normal. Sometimes we have, um, Sometimes we have accounts where they have like an where they go up like $* each day I'm sorry, not each day each year, so I just wanna see if that's the case with this one. Let's see. Each year, yeah. I think it is. OK. And. Let me just pull it up here. To the payment schedule. And yes, sir, that is exactly the case there. So, April was the last payment for $**.**. And so beginning May **** all the way through, um, April ****, the payments are gonna be $**.** each month on this account, OK? And now let me find the OK and now let me find the other one here for you, but it's the same address, the **. OK, I understood. West *th Street. All right. And so this one we're gonna call. I don't think that so that last one that we did, you wanna call that one system *, OK? And so now on system *. OK. That account number is gonna be *********. OK? OK. And so that one it looks like is on a promotion actually. And let me check it out. OK, yeah, that's really why I was calling because I, they look so different, the two prices. OK. Yeah. Yes, sir. So on that one looks like there is an eight month promotion on that account that began February ****, and it's ********. So for through September ****, you will only be paying $* a month for that account, OK? Beginning October ****, the payments are going to begin at $**.**. OK. And Got it. OK. I do not see where that account has an escalator, so that one will never change. It will be $**.** each month, OK? Oh, that's great and that's for like ** years or something? Mhm. So it expires on January *st, **,***,*** is when it expires, yes, sir. Got it. OK. OK, so there's no escalator on that one. No, sir. And that OK, what, what was the, uh, just curious, was the promotion something when the, the former owner like signed the contract that they got the first year or something for like $* a month? Mhm. Well, it is something that we generally do for um our customers whenever they open up the account. So I said the other one was labeled a system um *. Which is really weird because I would have expected the promotion to be on the other one instead of this one, but for whatever reason it's on this one and it does look like that first payment was made in February, so that makes sense. So maybe the other one was actually. OK. Mm. Yeah, maybe the other one is actually system one, yeah, maybe the other is actually system * and that this one is system * that would make more sense. Maybe in February of Wait, the OK. Sorry, but when was the first payment, February of this year or February of last year? February of this year, ****. Really? Yeah. That's we were in the when was the contract signed for the for the system for for this other system. Let me check here. I will say this though, contracts are signed way in advance, so that's not unusual. Let me go back. I'm going to the actual contract here to see. When it was signed. Uh, fine. It was actually signed. July of **** is when it was signed. Oh, but it was just it was installed in **** I guess and then. Yeah, it's probably so July **** is when it was actually signed and then let's see when it was actually activated. Let's see. I'm going through everything here. Yeah, it started being activated late September **** and then it was actually activated February of ****. That was a process, yeah. Oh, and they must have gotten the first year like for free then and then it became $* a month in February of this year and then. Yeah, not so, um, it was activated in February of ****, I mean **, it was verified as operational, um, in October of ****. So that was all us, right? So we have to verify it as operational before we ever start billing you and then we do need to contact the customer and make sure they understand all the terms of everything again before we start billing so. Um Got it. If it took a while to get in contact with them because we wouldn't have started billing to a minimum of ** days after we were able to make sure they understood all the terms and everything, yeah. Oh, I, I, OK. Yeah. So it was just a long process for them. I see, I see what you're saying. So I got on boarded I guess in February of this year when um when we when we closed on the house, um. Mhm. Mhm. Is there um. I I think there's like dashboards and stuff where I can see how the systems are performing and how much electricity they're producing, but I wouldn't get access. I remember at the time being told like I wouldn't get access right away um do you, do you know if those would be ready yet or? Right. Yeah, I can do that. I can get you access to that. Um, if that might take some more time. No, I can, it's just me sending you over a link here now, OK, so I will say that your, um, the email address that I have on file for you is Fleischer.Dan@gmail.com. Is that still a good email address? Uh, yes, it is. OK, so the username for which account? Well, no, I'm gonna do this the. Username for your account is gonna be your full email.**. OK? So it's the email address do your street number. And I've just sent you over that link and then you can just follow the prompts from there. OK. ** at the end of the email you said? Mhm. Is it uh sorry, is it ** or just **? **. At the end, **. OK, got it. uh, I got the email. Mhm. OK. So Yeah. Yeah, OK. Yeah, thank you so much. Oh, you're very welcome. So just a quick recap, we've gone over how much your billing is for each one, gone over the promotion for the second account as well, and also got you access to the customer portal. We did answer some questions about the install of the second system as well. Is there anything else that you need assistance with right now, Mr. Fleischer? Um, not at this time, thank you. OK.

60c288b2-8a20-4337-b355-0f99ccf70096,"Hello. Hey, Ms. Renata. How you doing? I'm OK. I'm trying to get my sinuses together. I've been battling for my knife. Uh, hold on. What you got my baby, mhm. Hold on, hold on. Let me do my whole spill. This is Anna from Passage and on a recorded line. Um, uh, my supervisor, she did go over the bills. She was calling you to explain it better than I can, and I don't want to talk to you with her. Let me see if I can pull up the bills first. OK. Mhm. Mm. ** And this is your account at [REDACTED]. Mhm. All right. So, Um. I'm looking for these bills. I just had it pulled up. There we go. So this one has the amount on there. No, that's the one on the. So the last bill I got was for the one due in March. So based on the bill, from what I see, the usage is really high. Yeah. So that, I know for sure she was gonna go over that because, all right. When it says company KWH to customer, that's how much your usage is, right? I don't know if you have a bill in front of you. Mhm. So your, your usage was, it's just an example. Let's just say let's go by the one from March that you sent me recently. So the company um company KWH customer. Mm mm. For I Your usage, yeah, the company can be customers your usage. So your usage is at *,***. That's pretty high actually. And then the sell back meaning what's left over from after utilizing the panels will be the customer of the company. OK OK. So your cell bank is ***. And I even checked to make sure that she wasn't on, you know, levelized billing because that plays a part in it too. But based upon the bill, like, so if you at work right now, is anyone at the house right now? Mm. My mom is there. Your mom, OK. Now, does, does she do more things? Only person. Only person that stay with me is me and my mama. Uh, my mama is disabled. She can't do anything. Yeah, I do So do you do mostly everything at the night, at night, you know, at night instead of the daytime? Yeah, when I get off. I don't really do nothing in the daytime cause I'm not there in the daytime. That. Right. So that explains it too, because Basically, the panels, they basically save more. You gotta do everything throughout the daytime, while, you know, especially sunny days, because that way you can utilize the energy from your panels versus the, the energy from actual energy. So, when you go home at night, there's not that much sunshine, and you're basically using the, you know, the power grid from energy. So that's probably why you feel like you're not saving because you're not, you know, you're not home throughout the daytime to really do much because you can't use your panels. So, Yeah. What I can do based upon the bill. And based upon your monthly savings. So you normally would say **. I can see. If I could get you a write down. So instead of paying **, I'm seeing that I could lower your bill. I can't promise anything. I have to go with my supervisor. So instead of $** a month to $** a month. Do you think You'll be able to afford that. All right, that's better. That's better. I think the main issue right now is because, like I said, you're working throughout the daytime, so you're not being, you don't get the chance to really utilize your pants unless you're off on the weekends, right? Or you're Mhm. So that's probably when you'll be able to really use the panels. So, moving forward, don't do too much at night, like washing clothes and everything, don't do that. Do it throughout the daytime when you can or the days you're off on the weekend. Sunny days are your best days. Reason being is because the solar panels get their power and they produce electricity from the sun. Yep. Yeah. That way you're on the grid from the solar panels and not the actual utility company that you, that you're with. Oy. Now, Ey, you know how they are. They can be iffy sometimes, sometimes they just We don't know why they're so high one day and then so low the next. That's, I don't know this entity. But I've also noticed too, winter time is gonna be the most crucial time. Reason being it's more cloudy days, it's colder days. The heater definitely jumps up your bill. Now that summer and, well, spring, should I say summer are approaching, more sunny days.
